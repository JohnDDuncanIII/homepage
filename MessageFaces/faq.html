        <dt><a name="howtouse">How do I use it?</a></dt>
        <dd> After installing the extension and restarting Thunderbird,
          open Tools -&gt; Extensions and double click MessageFaces. On
          the first tab of the settings window, you can choose the Face
          image for each identity. On the other tabs, you can enable
          support for the additional face types listed above. </dd>
        <dt><a name="725bytes">Why can't I use files larger than 725
            bytes?</a></dt>
        <dd> <a href="http://quimby.gnus.org/circus/face/">The Face
            header specification</a> dictates this to ensure your email
          can be properly processed by all mail servers (and you <i>do</i>
          want servers to transport your mail to the addressee, don't
          you?) Besides, not putting any limit on the image size
          needlessly bloats the message size. </dd>
        <dt><a name="gravatar-optional">Why is Gravatar support
            optional? Should I enable it?</a></dt>
        <dd> It is optional because it requires an active internet
          connection, and many people read their mail offline. If you do
          not, you should definitely enable it: Gravatars are displayed
          by an increasing number of weblogs next to the comment
          postings, so many people who don't even use Thunderbird or
          MessageFaces have their own Gravatar. </dd>
        <dt><a name="maxsize">How can I make the Face images larger,
            e.g. Gravatar?</a></dt>
        <dd> You can change the default maximum face size of 48 Pixels
          by changing a hidden preference. Install the <a
            href="http://aboutconfig.mozdev.org/">about:config extension
            (2016 edit: this is not built into the browser)</a>, then
          open Tools -&gt; about:config. Type <code>faces</code> into
          the filter field, then double click on the <code>extensions.messagefaces.maxsize</code>
          pref and enter a new size. Note that this setting will only
          enlarge Gravatar images and set the maximum size of local face
          images and Face URLs. Face header, picons, and X-Face images
          are unaffected, as their specification uses a fixed size of 48
          x 48 pixels. </dd>
        <dt><a name="xface-optional">Why is X-Face header support
            optional?</a></dt>
        <dd> The technique used by MessageFaces to decode the image data
          is not very fast. While you won't notice this on modern
          systems (e.g. PCs with 2 GHz and more), it can seriously
          affect older computers. If there is enough demand, I might
          decide to implement a new method of decoding (using C++ code
          instead of JavaScript), which will be much faster.<br>
          Ironically, the color Face Header is easier to process,
          because MessageFaces can let core Mozilla components do the
          main work. </dd>
        <dt><a name="customheaders">How can I set my own X-Face/Face
            URL?</a></dt>
        <dd> MessageFaces does not include a user interface for these
          tasks. However, you can <a href="customheaders.html">manually
            set these headers</a>. </dd>
        <dt><a name="faceURLs">What are Face URLs?</a></dt>
        <dd> Recently, the idea of putting a link to a photo of the
          sender into the mail has been made popular by Apple Computer's
          <a href="http://www.mac.com/">.Mac mail accounts</a>. It works
          by inserting a special header named "X-Image-URL" into the
          message, containing the http:// address of a picture that
          should be displayed. MessageFaces also supports the rare
          headers "X-Face-URL" and "Face-URL", which serve the same
          purpose. Note that you should read the security/privacy
          warning displayed in the MessageFaces settings window before
          activating this feature. </dd>
        <dt><a name="picons">Are picons supported?</a></dt>
        <dd> Yes. This feature was added in MessageFaces 1.2. Local
          picon searches were added in MessageFaces 1.2.1.<br>
        </dd>
        <dt><a name="favatars">Are favatars supported?</a></dt>
        <dd> No, and I will most certainly not add it. Favatars are
          meant to be added to weblog posts where the commenter entered
          the URI of his home page, which is then used to retrieve the
          favicon. As e-mails don't have a web page address in them,
          MessageFaces would have to use the sender's e-mail address
          instead. However, no one guarantees there <i>is</i> a web
          server behind that domain name, and even if there is, it's not
          very likely that the user has control over the top level
          directory (e.g. www.hotmail.com/). Additionally, a user's home
          page is often at an entirely different server than his e-mail
          address (perhaps because it's a hosting company, and his
          e-mail address is handled by his ISP). So unless people e-mail
          me and convince me that it's worth the effort, I'm not going
          to implement it - users have better options for online face
          images (e.g. <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/">gravatar.com</a>).

        <dt><a name="otherclients">What other mail/news clients support
            the Face header?</a></dt>
        <dd> Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen, the creator of the Face header,
          maintains a list of software that has Face support at <a
            href="http://quimby.gnus.org/circus/face/">http://quimby.gnus.org/circus/face/</a>
          (at the bottom of the page). The list is not very long, so it
          might be a good idea to convince your e-mail contacts to use
          Thunderbird (and MessageFaces) if they want to see your Face
          image ;-) </dd>
        <dt><a name="translate">Can I translate MessageFaces into
            another language?</a></dt>
        <dd> Translations are always welcome - please contact me (the
          maintainer) via the address given on the bottom of this page.
          I only ask for two things: first, send me your locale files,
          so I can incorporate them into the next release. Second,
          expect that I contact you asking to update your translation
          for new releases. </dd>
