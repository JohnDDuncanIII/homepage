\item Proficient at setting up a basic home file server in Windows and Unix environments, setting up a multi-router switch, and end-user local area network in Cisco Packet Tracer and with real hardware.
\item Competent using UNIX-like systems, the UNIX command line interface, UNIX configuration, and shell scripting. 
\item Here is a concise list of keywords that define technologies that I have worked with (experienced in \textbf{bold}): 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{golang}
	\item C/\textbf{C++}
	\item \textbf{Java}: including extensive work with Android SDK
	\item \textbf{Web}: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, DOM, Web-APIs, JSON, JIRA; golang, ruby, PHP
	\item sh, rc, awk, sed, perl
	\item SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL
	\item key/value stores
	\item UDP, TCP/IP, Bluetooth, USB, NFC, HTTP(S), REST, WS, QR-/Barcodes
	\item \textbf{git}, hg, svn, cvs

\begin{itemize}
	\item CNAV email portal: Found, documented, and disclosed a bug in the  Gettysburg Campus Navigation Portal (CNAV) electronic record keeping system, which was responsible for campus email list-servs, course directories, student information, etc. The bug was a priveledge escalation attack wherein a standard student user could delete any other user from any publicly-displayed group/email list-serv in the system.
	\item CNAV image leak: Discovered that user account images for all students/employees/etc. are publicly leaked to the web by the CNAV server.

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Major Projects}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d6u7eK2fBJElrRpEn1KlkTfReKO_tHj5iCAGb6vgtmg/}{Research @ MIT} (web/android; java/javascript/geoJSON/xml)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item As part of my summer work at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory (Summer '16), I created an android application (LEAV-EM) and a javascript web module for the LEAV and HVX programs, respectively. LEAV-EM alerts users in disaster affected areas (hurricanes/floods/tornadoes) to evacuate from their specific evacuation zone. State Emergency Managers (EMs) have the ability to set the status of the evacuation zones in my HVX module. LEAV-EM then routes users to the shelter that is closest to their current (or home) location and allows the user to directly interact with their state EMs. I designed, programmed, and developed the app individually.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/wiki}{Wiki}/\href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/blog}{CMS} (web; golang/flat-file db)
	\begin{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item I ported (to SeaMonkey), updated, and added many new features to an old Mozilla Suite add-on extension named MessageFaces (originally created by Jens Banneman). Newer features include: SeaMonkey compatibility, multiple header photo support, gravatar support (w/ caching), fast X-Face decodes to png instead of bmp (borrowed from mnenhy; original X-Face spec here), picon db support (both local and online databases), custom column support so you can visualize what headers senders are using, and (modern; TB 3+) address book contact photo support.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/picons}{Picons}: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item As part of this project, I created many 48x48 picons for various companies and organizations (the Lincoln Laboratory and Gettysburg logos above were created by me as part of this project) that are now included in Steve Kinzler's picon database.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/GettysburgMonumentsMap}{Gettysburg Battlefield Map} (web/android): 
	\begin{itemize}

Published to the \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.gettysburg.MonumentsMap}{Google Play Store} as \say{Gettysburg Monuments Map} and featured on the Gettysburg College \href{http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/press_release_detail.dot?id=6bb9e711-cbbd-4c0d-98c8-ca379ebc5321}{Homepage}. On the web at \url{http://historicgettysburg.us/}
	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/PokerSquares}{PokerSquares} (android; java/xml; neural-net): 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed, implemented, and coded an Android application to play the classic solitaire-based card game \say{Poker Squares} (utilizing a Native Abstract Reinforcement Learning (NARL) Artificial Intelligence player created by my adviser Dr. Todd W. Neller). Available for download from the \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.gettysburg.pokersquares}{Google Play Store}.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/RedLightRace}{RedLightRace} (android; java/xml; neural-net): 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed, implemented, and coded an Android application called \say{Red Light Race} published to the \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.gettysburg.redlight}{Google Play Store} and utilizing a neural network approximately player created by Dr. Todd W. Neller and Marcin Malec (‘13) of Gettysburg College. Featured on the Gettysburg College \href{http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/press_release_detail.dot?id=16f6ea27-401c-42b2-bf77-c5c8ab319ee1}{Homepage} for my work.
	\end{itemize}

	\item I worked on a Classic Macintosh Typeface conversion project where I created data-fork (.dfont) and fontforge (.sfd) versions of every resource-fork typeface that Apple has shipped (including branding) dating back to the XEROX ALTO in 1979. Sources ranged from pre-release Macintosh versions based on the XEROX STAR operating system all the way up to pre-release versions of OS X (rhapsody).
	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/Platinum}{Platinum OS X Theme} (macOS; .car hacking/GIMP): 
	\begin{itemize}

	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/PlayingCards}{Playing Cards} (gif/png; GIMP): 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Adapted many different public domain playing card sets into one \href{http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~duncjo01/PlayingCards/}{centralized location} for ease of use; created custom skat playing card sets in normal and small sizes (with iconography that I created myself).
	\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/JohnDDuncanIII/JohnDDuncanIII.github.io}{Personal Homepage} (web; html5/css3/js/php): 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item I suppose this site itself could be considered a major project. All html, css, (and most) js were written \& created by me. I also created a markdown-to-html shell conversion script (using sed and awk) for my blog and a 7-day \href{http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~duncjo01/assets/scripts/weather.js}{weather forecast script} (parsing information from NWS api \& getting location w/ HTML5 geolocation) for my \href{http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~duncjo01/}{homepage}.

\section*{Philosophy}
Simplicity is core to my software development, because it leads to;
\begin{itemize}
	\item fewer bugs,
	\item better performance,
	\item lower memory footprint,
	\item better maintainability,
	\item higher scalability,
	\item longer software lifetime, 
	\item prompt delivery; 
\end{itemize}
...all of which lead to a better quality finished product.

\section*{Hobbies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item computer programming since 2009
    \item design (user interface, software, cyberpunk)
    \item philosophy (of software, knowledge, aesthetics, technology)
    \item music (singing, listening to all genres \& varieties, playing guitar, bass guitar, and trumpet)
    \item programming \& open source
    \item history (technology/web-related, ancient)
    \item biotechnology \& biohacking
\end{itemize}

I devote much of my free time to developing and exploring software and software technologies. I am passionate about trying to port as much free and open-source software to macOS as possible.\\

I am a hobbyist philosopher, UNIX hacker, and political, economic, and media theorist.\\

I'm a free and open-source software enthusiasist. My website is full of online applications, source code and articles that can be used to examine my style.\\

When it comes to software and design, I am passionate about simplicity, beauty, and purity. I have done some 9front development, and highly recommend Plan 9 from Bell Labs for hobbyist OS developers.\\

My design aesthetic is highly influenced by the 80's and 90's computer art movements. When designing, I attempt to blend the best of color-constrained bitmap graphics (dithered/small color palettes), florals, neons, black \& white, and "retro" patterns (found on old tour busses, operating systems, programs) with modern platforms and features.
