And as twilight passed into the evening I felt my Special plan for which there are no words Moving towards a greater darkness ... ... <br> There are some who have no voices Or none that will ever speak, Because of the things they know about this world And the things they feel about this world ... Exist in other worlds. Countless other worlds, Each of which stands alone in an infinite empty blackness For which no words are being conceived And where no voices are able to speak. When a brain is filled only with damaged thoughts. When a damaged body is filled only with pain And stands alone in a world surrounded by infinite empty blackness And exists in a world for which there is no special plan ... ...

                    <i>``The tribalizing power of the new electronic media, the way in which they return to us to the unified fields of the old oral cultures, to tribal cohesion and pre-individualist patterns of thought, is little understood. Tribalism is the sense of the deep bond of family, the closed society as the norm of community."</i>
