            <P>AN IRONIC DREAM OF A COMMON LANGUAGE FOR WOMEN IN THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT</P>

            <P>&nbsp;This chapter is an effort to build an ironic political myth faithful
                to feminism, socialism, and materialism. Perhaps more faithful as blasphemy
                is faithful, than as reverent worship and identification. Blasphemy has
                always seemed to require taking things very seriously. I know no better
                stance to adopt from within the secular-religious, evangelical traditions
                of United States politics, including the politics of socialist feminism.
                Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still insisting
                on the need for community. Blasphemy is not apostasy. Irony is about contradictions
                that do not resolve into larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension
                of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary
                and true. Irony is about humour and serious play. It is also a rhetorical
                strategy and a political method, one I would like to see more honoured within
                socialist-feminism. At the centre of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the
                image of the cyborg.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism,
                a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. Social reality
                is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a
                world-changing fiction. The international women's movements have constructed
                'women's experience', as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective
                object. This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political
                kind. Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative
                apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. The cyborg is a matter
                of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women's experience
                in the late twentieth century. This is a struggle over life and death, but
                the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs - creatures simultaneously
                animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously natural and crafted.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>150</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of couplings between organism
                and machine, each conceived as coded devices, in an intimacy and with a
                power that was not generated in the history of sexuality. Cyborg 'sex' restores
                some of the lovely replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such
                nice organic prophylactics against heterosexism). Cyborg replication is
                uncoupled from organic reproduction. Modern production seems like a dream
                of cyborg colonization work, a dream that makes the nightmare of Taylorism
                seem idyllic. And modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by C3I, command-control-communication-intelligence,
                an $84 billion item in 1984'sUS defence budget. I am making an argument
                for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as
                an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings. Michael
                Foucault's biopolitics is a flaccid premonition of cyborg politics, a very
                open field.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras,
                theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are
                cyborgs. Ths cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. The cyborg
                is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined
                centres structuring any possibility of historical transformation. In the
                traditions of 'Western' science and politics--the tradition of racist, male-dominant
                capitalism; the tradition of progress; the tradition of the appropriation
                of nature as resource for the productions of culture; the tradition of reproduction
                of the self from the reflections of the other - the relation between organism
                and machine has been a border war. The stakes in the border war have been
                the territories of production, reproduction, and imagination. This chapter
                is an argument for pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and for responsibility
                in their construction. It is also an effort to contribute to socialist-feminist
                culture and theory in a postmodernist, non-naturalist mode and in the utopian
                tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world
                without genesis, but maybe also a world without end. The cyborg incarnation
                is outside salvation history. Nor does it mark time on an oedipal calendar,
                attempting to heal the terrible cleavages of gender in an oral symbiotic
                utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse. As Zoe Sofoulis argues in her unpublished
                manuscript on Jacques Lacan, Melanie Klein, and nuclear culture, Lacklein,
                the most terrible and perhaps the most promising monsters in cyborg worlds
                are embodied in non-oedipal narratives with a different logic of repression,
                which we need to understand for our survival.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The cyborg is a creature in a post-gender world; it has no truck with
                bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labour, or other seductions
                to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all the powers of
                the parts into a higher unity. In a sense, the cyborg has no origin story
                in the Western sense - a 'final' irony since the cyborg is also the awful
                apocalyptic telos of the</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>151</P>

            <P>'West's' escalating dominations of abstract individuation, an ultimate
                self untied at last from all dependency, a man in space. An origin story
                in the 'Western', humanist sense depends on the myth of original unity,
                fullness, bliss and terror, represented by the phallic mother from whom
                all humans must separate, the task of individual development and of history,
                the twin potent myths inscribed most powerfully for us in psychoanalysis
                and Marxism. Hilary Klein has argued that both Marxism and psychoanalysis,
                in their concepts of labour and of individuation and gender formation, depend
                on the plot of original unity out of which difference must be produced and
                enlisted in a drama of escalating domination of woman/nature. The cyborg
                skips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the Western
                sense. This is its illegitimate promise that might lead to subversion of
                its teleology as star wars.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and
                perversity. It is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence.
                No longer structured by the polarity of public and private, the cyborg defines
                a technological polls based partly on a revolution of social relations in
                the oikos, the household. Nature and culture are reworked; the one can no
                longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other.
                The rela-tionships for forming wholes from parts, including those of polarity
                and hierarchical domination, are at issue in the cyborg world. Unlike the
                hopes of Frankenstein's monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to
                save it through a restoration of the garden; that is, through the fabrication
                of a heterosexual mate, through its completion in a finished whole, a city
                and cosmos. The eyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic
                family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize
                the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning
                to dust. Perhaps that is why I want to see if eyborgs can subvert the apocalypse
                of returning to nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the Enemy.
                Cyborgs are not reverent; they do not re-member the cosmos. They are wary
                of holism, but needy for connection- they seem to have a natural feel for
                united front politics, but without the vanguard party. The main trouble
                with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of
                militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But
                illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins.
                Their fathers, after all, are inessential.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>I will return to the science fiction of cyborgs at the end of this chapter,
                but now I want to signal three crucial boundary breakdowns that make the
                following political-fictional (political-scientific) analysis possible.
                By the late twentieth century in United States scientific culture, the boundary
                between human and animal is thoroughly breached. The last beachheads of
                uniqueness have been polluted if not turned into amusement parks--language
                tool</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>152</P>

            <P>use, social behaviour, mental events, nothing really convincingly settles
                the separation of human and animal. And many people no longer feel the need
                for such a separation; indeed, many branches of feminist culture affirm
                the pleasure of connection of human and other living creatures. Movements
                for animal rights are not irrational denials of human uniqueness; they are
                a clear-sighted recognition of connection across the discredited breach
                of nature and culture. Biology and evolutionary theory over the last two
                centuries have simultaneously produced modern organisms as objects of knowledge
                and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace re-etched
                in ideological struggle or professional disputes between life and social
                science. Within this framework, teaching modern Christian creationism should
                be fought as a form of child abuse.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Biological-determinist ideology is only one position opened up in scientific
                culture for arguing the meanings of human animality. There is much room
                for radical political people to contest the meanings of the breached boundary.2
                The cyborg appears in myth precisely where the boundary between human and
                animal is transgressed. Far from signalling a walling off of people from
                other living beings, cyborgs signal distrurbingly and pleasurably tight
                coupling. Bestiality has a new status in this cycle of marriage exchange.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The second leaky distinction is between animal-human (organism) and machine.
                Pre-cybernetic machines could be haunted; there was always the spectre of
                the ghost in the machine. This dualism structured the dialogue between materialism
                and idealism that was settled by a dialectical progeny, called spirit or
                history, according to taste. But basically machines were not self-moving,
                self-designing, autonomous. They could not achieve man's dream, only mock
                it. They were not man, an author to himself, but only a caricature of that
                masculinist reproductive dream. To think they were otherwise was paranoid.
                Now we are not so sure. Late twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly
                ambiguous the difference between natural and art)ficial, mind and body,
                self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that
                used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively,
                and we ourselves frighteningly inert.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Technological determination is only one ideological space opened up by
                the reconceptions of machine and organism as coded texts through which we
                engage in the play of writing and reading the world.3 'Textualization' of
                everything in poststructuralist, postmodernist theory has been damned by
                Marxists and socialist feminists for its utopian disregard for the lived
                relations of domination that ground the 'play' of arbitrary reading.4 It
                is certainly true that postmodernist strategies, like my cyborg myth, subvert
                myriad organic wholes (for example, the poem, the primitive culture, the
                biological organism). In short, the certainty of what counts as nature --
                a</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>153</P>

            <P>source of insight and promise of innocence -- is undermined, probably
                fatally. The transcendent authorization of interpretation is lost, and with
                it the ontology grounding 'Western' epistemology. But the alternative is
                not cynicism or faithlessness, that is, some version of abstract existence,
                like the accounts of technological determinism destroying 'man' by the 'machine'
                or 'meaningful political action' by the 'text'. Who cyborgs will be is a
                radical question; the answers are a matter of survival. Both chimpanzees
                and artefacts have politics, so why shouldn't we (de Waal, 1982; Winner,
                1980)?</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The third distinction is a subset of the second: the boundary between
                physical and non-physical is very imprecise for us. Pop physics books on
                the consequences of quantum theory and the indeterminacy principle are a
                kind of popular scientific equivalent to Harlequin romances* as a marker
                of radical change in American white heterosexuality: they get it wrong,
                but they are on the right subject. Modern machines are quintessentially
                microelectronic devices: they are everywhere and they are invisible. Modern
                machinery is an irreverent upstart god, mocking the Father's ubiquity and
                spirituality. The silicon chip is a surface for writing; it is etched in
                molecular scales disturbed only by atomic noise, the ultimate interference
                for nuclear scores. Writing, power, and technology are old partners in Western
                stories of the origin of civilization, but miniaturization has changed our
                experience of mechanism. Miniaturization has turned out to be about power;
                small is not so much beautiful as pre-eminently dangerous, as in cruise
                missiles. Contrast the TV sets of the 1950s or the news cameras of the 1970s
                with the TV wrist bands or hand-sized video cameras now advertised. Our
                best machines are made of sunshine; they are all light and clean because
                they are nothing but signals, electromagnetic waves, a section of a spectrum,
                and these machines are eminently portable, mobile -- a matter of immense
                human pain in Detroit and Singapore. People are nowhere near so fluid, being
                both material and opaque. Cyborgs are ether, quintessence.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The ubiquity and invisibility of cyborgs is precisely why these sunshine-belt
                machines are so deadly. They are as hard to see politically as materially.
                They are about consciousness - or its simulation.5 They are floating signIfiers
                moving in pickup trucks across Europe, blocked more effectively by the witch-weavings
                of the displaced and so unnatural Greenham women, who read the cyborg webs
                of power so very well, than by the militant labour of older masculinist
                politics, whose natural constituency needs defence jobs. Ultimately the
                'hardest' science is about the realm of greatest boundary confusion, the
                realm of pure number, pure spirit, C3I, cryptography, and the preservation
                of potent secrets. The new machines are so clean and light. Their engineers
                are sun-worshippers mediating a new scientific revolution</P>

            <P>*The US equivalent of Mills &amp; Boon.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>154</P>

            <P>associated with the night dream of post-industrial society. The diseases
                evoked by these clean machines are 'no more' than the minuscule coding changes
                of an antigen in the immune system, 'no more' than the experience of stress.
                The nimble fingers of 'Oriental' women, the old fascination of little Anglo-Saxon
                Victorian girls with doll's houses, women's enforced attention to the small
                take on quite new dimensions in this world. There might be a cyborg Alice
                taking account of these new dimensions. Ironically, it might be the unnatural
                cyborg women making chips in Asia and spiral dancing in Santa Rita jail*
                whose constructed unities will guide effective oppositional strategies.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>So my cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and
                dangerous possibilities which progressive people might explore as one part
                of needed political work. One of my premises is that most American socialists
                and feminists see deepened dualisms of mind and body, animal and machine,
                idealism and materialism in the social practices, symbolic formula-tions,
                and physical artefacts associated with 'high technology' and scientific
                culture. From One-DimensionalMan (Marcuse, 1964) to The Death of Nature
                (Merchant, 1980), the analytic resources developed by progressives have
                insisted on the necessary domination of technics and recalled us to an imagined
                organic body to integrate our resistance. Another of my premises is that
                the need for unity of people trying to resist world-wide intensification
                of domination has never been more acute. But a slightly perverse shift of
                perspective might better enable us to contest for meanings, as well as for
                other forms of power and pleasure in technologically mediated societies.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>From one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of
                a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in
                a Star Wars apocalypse waged in the name of defence, about the final appropriation
                of women's bodies in a masculinist orgy of war (Sofia, 1984). From another
                perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities
                in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines,
                not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints.
                The political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because
                each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimaginable from the other
                vantage point. Single vision produces worse illusions than double vision

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>It has become difficult to name one's feminism by a single adjective
                -- or even to insist in every circumstance upon the noun. Consciousness
                of exclusion through naming is acute. Identities seem contradictory, partial,
                and strategic. With the hard-won recognition of their social and historical
                constitution, gender, race, and class cannot provide the basis for belief
                in 'essential' unity. There is nothing about teeing 'female' that naturally
                binds women. There is not even such a state as 'being' female, itself a
                highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses
                and other social practices. Gender, race, or class consciousness is an achievement
                forced on us by the terrible historica experience of the contradictory social
                realities of patriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism. And who counts as
                'us' in my own rhetoric? Which identities are available to ground such a
                potent political myth called 'us', and what could motivate enlistment in
                this collectivity? Painful fragmentation among feminists (not to mention
                among women) along every possible fault line has made the concept of woman
                elusive, an excuse for the matrix of women's dominations of each other.
                For me - and for many who share a similar historical location in white,
                professional middle-class, female, radical, North American, mid-adult bodies
                - the sources of a crisis in political identity are legion. The recent history
                for much of the US left and US feminism has been a response to this kind
                of crisis by endless splitting and searches for a new essential unity. But
                there has also been a growing recognition of another response through coalition
                - affinity, not identity.7</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Chela Sandoval (n.d., 1984), from a consideration of specific historical
                moments in the formation of the new political voice called women of colour,
                has theorized a hopeful model of political identity called 'oppositional
                consciousness', born of the skills for reading webs of power by those refused
                stable membership in the social categories of race, sex, or class. 'Women
                of color', a name contested at its origins by those whom it would incorporate,
                as well as a historical consciousness marking systematic breakdown of all
                the signs of Man in 'Western' traditions, constructs a kind of postmodernist
                identity out of otherness, difference, and specificity. This postmodernist
                identity is fully political, whatever might be said abut other possible
                postmodernisms. Sandoval's oppositional consciousness is about contradic-</P>

            <P>tory locations and heterochronic calendars, not about relativisms and
                pluralisms.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Sandoval emphasizes the lack of any essential criterion for identifying
                who is a woman of colour. She notes that the definition of the group has
                been by conscious appropriation of negation. For example, a Chicana or US
                black woman has not been able to speak as a woman or as a black person or
                as a Chicano. Thus, she was at the bottom of a cascade of negative identities,
                left out of even the privileged oppressed authorial categories called 'women
                and blacks', who claimed to make the important revolutions. The category
                'woman' negated all non-white women; 'black' negated all non-black people,
                as well as all black women. But there was also no 'she', no singularity,
                but a sea of differences among US women who have affirmed their historical
                identity as US women of colour. This identity marks out a self-consciously
                constructed space that cannot affirm the capacity to act on the basis of
                natural identification, but only on the basis of conscious coalition, of
                affinity, of political kinship.8 Unlike the 'woman' of some streams of the
                white women's movement in the United States, there is no naturalization
                of the matrix, or at least this is what Sandoval argues is uniquely available
                through the power of oppositional consciousness.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Sandoval's argument has to be seen as one potent formulation for feminists
                out of the world-wide development of anti-colonialist discourse; that is
                to say, discourse dissolving the 'West' and its highest product - the one
                who is not animal, barbarian, or woman; man, that is, the author of a cosmos
                called history. As orientalism is deconstructed politically and semiotically,
                the identities of the occident destabilize, including those of feminists.9
                Sandoval argues that 'women of colour' have a chance to build an effective
                unity that does not replicate the imperializing, totalizing revolutionary
                subjects of previous Marxisms and feminisms which had not faced the consequences
                of the disorderly polyphony emerging from decolonization.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Katie King has emphasized the limits of identification and the political/
                poetic mechanics of identification built into reading 'the poem', that generative
                core of cultural feminism. King criticizes the persistent tendency among
                contemporary feminists from different 'moments' or 'conversations' in feminist
                practice to taxonomize the women's movement to make one's own political
                tendencies appear to be the telos of the whole. These taxonomies tend to
                remake feminist history so that it appears to be an ideological struggle
                among coherent types persisting over time, especially those typical units
                called radical, liberal, and socialist-feminism. Literally, all other feminisms
                are either incorporated or marginalized, usually by building an explicit
                ontology and epistemology.10 Taxonomies of feminism produce epistemologies
                to police deviation from official women's experience. And of course, 'women's
                culture', like women of colour, is consciously created by</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>157</P>

            <P>mechanisms inducing affinity. The rituals of poetry, music, and certain
                forms of academic practice have been pre-eminent. The politics of race and
                culture in the US women's movements are intimately interwoven. The common
                achievement of King and Sandoval is learning how to craft a poetic/political
                unity without relying on a logic of appropriation, incorpora-tion, and taxonomic
                identification.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The theoretical and practical struggle against unity-through-domination
                or unity-through-incorporation ironically not only undermines the justifica-tions
                for patriarchy, colonialism, humanism, positivism, essentialism, scient-ism,
                and other unlamented -isms, but all claims for an organic or natural standpoint.
                I think that radical and socialist/Marxist-feminisms have also undermined
                their/our own epistemological strategies and that this is a crucially valuable
                step in imagining possible unities. It remains to be seen whether all 'epistemologies'
                as Western political people have known them fail us in the task to build
                effective affinities.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>It is important to note that the effort to construct revolutionary stand-points,
                epistemologies as achievements of people committed to changing the world,
                has been part of the process showing the limits of identification. The acid
                tools of postmodernist theory and the constructive tools of ontological
                discourse about revolutionary subjects might be seen as ironic allies in
                dissolving Western selves in the interests of survival. We are excruciatingly
                conscious of what it means to have a historically constituted body. But
                with the loss of innocence in our origin, there is no expulsion from the
                Garden either. Our politics lose the indulgence of guilt with the naivete
                of innocence. But what would another political myth for socialist-feminism
                look like? What kind of politics could embrace partial, contradictory, permanently
                unclosed constructions of personal and collective selves and still be faithful,
                effective - and, ironically, socialist-feminist?</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>I do not know of any other time in history when there was greater need
                for political unity to confront effectively the dominations of 'race', 'gender',
                'sexuality', and 'class'. I also do not know of any other time when the
                kind of unity we might help build could have been possible. None of 'us'
                have any longer the symbolic or material capability of dictating the shape
                of reality to any of'them'. Or at least 'we' cannot claim innocence from
                practicing such dominations. White women, including socialist feminists,
                discovered (that is, were forced kicking and screaming to notice) the non-innocence
                of the category 'woman'. That consciousness changes the geography of all
                previous categories; it denatures them as heat denatures a fragile protein.
                Cyborg feminists have to argue that 'we' do not want any more natural matrix
                of unity and that no construction is whole. Innocence, and the corollary
                insistence on victimhood as the only ground for insight, has done enough
                damage. But the constructed revolutionary subject must give late-twentieth-</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>158</P>

            <P>century people pause as well. In the fraying of identities and in the
                reflexive strategies for constructing them, the possibility opens up for
                weaving something other than a shroud for the day after the apocalypse that
                so prophetically ends salvation history.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Both Marxist/socialist-feminisms and radical feminisms have simul-taneously
                naturalized and denatured the category 'woman' and conscious-ness of the
                social lives of 'women'. Perhaps a schematic caricature can highlight both
                kinds of moves. Marxian socialism is rooted in an analysis of wage labour
                which reveals class structure. The consequence of the wage relationship
                is systematic alienation, as the worker is dissociated from his (sic) product.
                Abstraction and illusion rule in knowledge, domination rules in practice.
                Labour is the pre-eminently privileged category enabling the Marxist to
                overcome illusion and find that point of view which is necessary for changing
                the world. Labour is the humanizing activity that makes man; labour is an
                ontological category permitting the knowledge of a subject, and so the knowledge
                of subjugation and alienation.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>In faithful filiation, socialist-feminism advanced by allying itself
                with the basic analytic strategies of Marxism. The main achievement of both
                Marxist feminists and socialist feminists was to expand the category of
                labour to accommodate what (some) women did, even when the wage relation
                was subordinated to a more comprehensive view of labour under capitalist
                patriarchy. In particular, women's labour in the household and women's activity
                as mothers generally (that is, reproduction in the socialist-feminist sense),
                entered theory on the authority of analogy to the Marxian concept of labour.
                The unity of women here rests on an epistemology based on the ontological
                structure of'labour'. Marxist/socialist-feminism does not 'natur-alize'
                unity; it is a possible achievement based on a possible standpoint rooted
                in social relations. The essentializing move is in the ontological structure
                of labour or of its analogue, women's activity.11 The inheritance of Marxian
                humanism, with its pre-eminently Western self, is the difficulty for me.
                The contribution from these formulations has been the emphasis on the daily
                responsibility of real women to build unities, rather than to naturalize
                them.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Catherine MacKinnon's (198Z, 1987) version of radical feminism is itself
                a caricature of the appropriating, incorporating, totalizing tendencies
                of Western theories of identity grounding action.12 It is factually and
                politically wrong to assimilate all of the diverse 'moments' or 'conversations'
                in recent women's politics named radical feminism to MacKinnon's version.
                But the teleological logic of her theory shows how an epistemology and ontology
                - including their negations - erase or police difference. Only one of the
                effects of MacKinnon's theory is the rewriting of the history of the polymorphous
                field called radical feminism. The major effect is the production of a theory</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>159</P>

            <P>of experience, of women's identity, that is a kind of apocalypse for
                all revolutionary standpoints. That is, the totalization built into this
                tale of radical feminism achieves its end - the unity of women - by enforcing
                the experience of and testimony to radical non-being. As for the Marxist/
                socialist feminist, consciousness is an achievement, not a natural fact.
                And MacKinnon's theory eliminates some of the difficulties built into humanist
                revolutionary subjects, but at the cost of radical reductionism.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>MacKinnon argues that feminism necessarily adopted a different analyt-ical
                strategy from Marxism, looking first not at the structure of class, but
                at the structure of sex/gender and its generative relationship, men's constitu-tion
                and appropriation of women sexually. Ironically, MacKinnon's 'ontology'
                constructs a non-subject, a non-being. Another's desire, not the self's
                labour, is the origin of 'woman'. She therefore develops a theory of consciousness
                that enforces what can count as 'women's' experience - anything that names
                sexual violation, indeed, sex itself as far as 'women' can be concerned.
                Feminist practice is the construction of this form of consciousness; that
                is, the self-knowledge of a self-who-is-not.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Perversely, sexual appropriation in this feminism still has the epistemolo-gical
                status of labour; that is to say, the point from which an analysis able
                to contribute to changing the world must flow. But sexual object)fication,
                not alienation, is the consequence of the structure of sex/gender. In the
                realm of knowledge, the result of sexual objectification is illusion and
                abstraction. However, a woman is not simply alienated from her product,
                but in a deep sense does not exist as a subject, or even potential subject,
                since she owes her existence as a woman to sexual appropriation. To be constituted
                by another's desire is not the same thing as to be alienated in the violent
                separation of the labourer from his product.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>MacKinnon's radical theory of experience is totalizing in the extreme;
                it does not so much marginalize as obliterate the authority of any other
                women's political speech and action. It is a totalization producing what
                Western patriarchy itself never succeeded in doing - feminists' consciousness
                of the non-existence of women, except as products of men's desire. I think
                MacKinnon correctly argues that no Marxian version of identity can firmly
                ground women's unity. But in solving the problem of the contradictions of
                any Western revolutionary subject for feminist purposes, she develops an
                even more authoritarian doctrine of experience. If my complaint about socialist/Marxian
                standpoints is their unintended erasure of polyvocal, unassimilable, radical
                difference made visible in anti-colonial discourse and practice, MacKinnon's
                intentional erasure of all difference through the device of the 'essential'
                non-existence of women is not reassuring.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>In my taxonomy, which like any other taxonomy is a re-inscription of
                history, radical feminism can accommodate all the activities of women named
                by socialist feminists as forms of labour only if the activity can somehow
                be sexualized. Reproduction had different tones of meanings for the two
                tendencies, one rooted in labour, one in sex, both calling the consequences
                of domination and ignorance of social and personal reality 'false consciousness'.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Beyond either the diff~culties or the contributions in the argument of
                any one author, neither Marxist nor radical feminist points of view have
                tended to embrace the status of a partial explanation; both were regularly
                constituted as totalities. Western explanation has demanded as much; how
                else could the 'Western' author incorporate its others? Each tried to annex
                other forms of domination by expanding its basic categories through analogy,
                simple listing, or addition. Embarrassed silence about race among white
                radical and socialist feminists was one major, devastating political consequence.
                History and polyvocality disappear into political taxonomies that try to
                establish genealogies. There was no structural room for race (or for much
                else) in theory claiming to reveal the construction of the category woman
                and social group women as a unified or totalizable whole. The structure
                of my caricature looks like this:</P>

                that as objects of knowledge and as historical actors, 'race' did not always
                exist, 'class' has a historical genesis, and 'homosexuals' are quite junior.
                It is no accident that the symbolic system of the family of man - and so
                the essence of woman - breaks up at the same moment that networks of connection
                among people on the planet are unprecedentedly multiple, pregnant, and complex.
                'Advanced capitalism' is inadequate to convey the structure of this historical
                moment. In the 'Western' sense, the end of man is at stake. It is no accident
                that woman disintegrates into women in our time. Perhaps socialist feminists
                were not substantially guilty of producing essentialist theory that suppressed
                women's particularity and contradictory interests. I think we have been,
                at least through unreflective participation in the logics, languages, and
                practices of white humanism and through searching for a single ground of
                domination to secure our revolutionary voice. Now we have less excuse. But
                in the consciousness of our failures, we</P>

            <P>risk lapsing into boundless difference and giving up on the confusing
                task of making partial, real connection. Some differences are playful; some
                are poles of world historical systems of domination. 'Epistemology' is about
                knowing the difference.</P>

            <P>THE INFORMATICS OF DOMINATION</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>In this attempt at an epistemological and political position, I would
                like to sketch a picture of possible unity, a picture indebted to socialist
                and feminist principles of design. The frame for my sketch is set by the
                extent and importance of rearrangements in world-wide social relations tied
                to science and technology. I argue for a politics rooted in claims about
                fundamental changes in the nature of class, race, and gender in an emerging
                system of world order analogous in its novelty and scope to that created
                by industrial capitalism; we are living through a movement from an organic,
                industrial society to a polymorphous, information system--from all work
                to all play, a deadly game. Simultaneously material and ideological, the
                dichotomies may be expressed in the following chart of transitions from
                the comfortable old hierarchical dominations to the scary new networks I
                have called the informatics of domination:</P>

            <P>162</P>

            <P>This list suggests several interesting things.13 First, the objects on
                the right-hand side cannot be coded as 'natural', a realization that subverts
                naturalistic coding for the left-hand side as well. We cannot go back ideologically
                or materially. It's not just that igod'is dead; so is the 'goddess'. Or
                both are revivified in the worlds charged with microelectronic and biotechnological
                politics. In relation to objects like biotic components, one must not think
                in terms of essential properties, but in terms of design, boundary constraints,
                rates of flows, systems logics, costs of lowering constraints. Sexual reproduction
                is one kind of reproductive strategy among many, with costs and benefits
                as a function of the system environment. Ideologies of sexual reproduction
                can no longer reasonably call on notions of sex and sex role as organic
                aspects in natural objects like organisms and families. Such reasoning will
                be unmasked as irrational, and ironically corporate executives reading Playboy
                and anti-porn radical feminists will make strange bedfellows in jointly
                unmasking the irrationalism.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Likewise for race, ideologies about human diversity have to be formulated
                in terms of frequencies of parameters, like blood groups or intelligence
                scores. It is 'irrational' to invoke concepts like primitive and civilized.
                For liberals and radicals, the search for integrated social systems gives
                way to a new practice called 'experimental ethnography' in which an organic
                object dissipates in attention to the play of writing. At the level of ideology,
                we see translations of racism and colonialism into languages of development
                and under-development, rates and constraints of modernization. Any objects
                or persons can be reasonably thought of in terms of disassembly and reassembly;
                no 'natural' architectures constrain system design. The financial districts
                in all the world's cities, as well as the export-processing and free-trade
                zones, proclaim this elementary fact of'late capitalism'. The entire universe
                of objects that can be known scientifically must be formulated as problems
                in</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>163</P>

            <P>communications engineering (for the managers) or theories of the text
                (for those who would resist). Both are cyborg semiologies.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>One should expect control strategies to concentrate on boundary conditions
                and interfaces, on rates of flow across boundaries-- and not on the integrity
                of natural objects. 'Integrity' or 'sincerity' of the Western self gives
                way to decision procedures and expert systems. For example, control strategies
                applied to women's capacities to give birth to new human beings will be
                developed in the languages of population control and maximization of goal
                achievement for individual decision-makers. Control strategies will be formulated
                in terms of rates, costs of constraints, degrees of freedom. Human beings,
                like any other component or subsystem, must be localized in a system architecture
                whose basic modes of operation are probabilistic, statistical. No objects,
                spaces, or bodies are sacred in themselves; any component can be interfaced
                with any other if the proper standard, the proper code, can be constructed
                for processing signals in a common language. Exchange in this world transcends
                the universal translation effected by capitalist markets that Marx analysed
                so well. The privileged pathology affecting all kinds of components in this
                universe is stress - communications breakdown (Hogness, 1983). The cyborg
                is not subject to Foucault's biopolitics; the cyborg simulates politics,
                a much more potent field of operations.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>This kind of analysis of scientific and cultural objects of knowledge
                which have appeared historically since the Second World War prepares us
                to notice some important inadequacies in feminist analysis which has proceeded
                as if the organic, hierarchical dualisms ordering discourse in 'the West'
                since Aristotle still ruled. They have been cannibalized, or as Zoe Sofia
                (Sofoulis) might put it, they have been 'techno-digested'. The dichotomies
                between mind and body, animal and human, organism and machine, public and
                private, nature and culture, men and women, primitive and civilized are
                all in question ideologically. The actual situation of women is their integration/
                exploitation into a world system of production/reproduction and com-munication
                called the informatics of domination. The home, workplace, market, public
                arena, the body itself- all can be dispersed and interfaced in nearly infinite,
                polymorphous ways, with large consequences for women and others - consequences
                that themselves are very different for different people and which make potent
                oppositional international movements difficult to imagine and essential
                for survival. One important route for reconstructing socialist-feminist
                politics is through theory and practice addressed to the social relations
                of science and technology, including crucially the systems of myth and meanings
                structuring our imaginations. The cyborg is a kind of disassembled and reassembled,
                postmodern collective and personal self. This is the self feminists must
                code.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>164</P>

            <P>Communications technologies and biotechnologies are the crucial tools
                recrafting our bodies. These tools embody and enforce new social relations
                for women world-wide. Technologies and scientific discourses can be partially
                understood as formalizations, i.e., as frozen moments, of the fluid social
                interactions constituting them, but they should also be viewed as instruments
                for enforcing meanings. The boundary is permeable between tool and myth,
                instrument and concept, historical systems of social relations and historical
                anatomies of possible bodies, including objects of knowledge. Indeed, myth
                and tool mutually constitute each other.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Furthermore, communications sciences and modern biologies are constructed
                by a common move - the translation of the world into a problem of coding,
                a search for a common language in which all resistance to instrumental control
                disappears and all heterogeneity can be submitted to disassembly, reassembly,
                investment, and exchange.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>In communications sciences, the translation of the world into a problem
                in coding can be illustrated by looking at cybernetic (feedback-controlled)
                systems theories applied to telephone technology, computer design, weapons
                deployment, or data base construction and maintenance. In each case, solution
                to the key questions rests on a theory of language and control; the key
                operation is determining the rates, directions, and probabilities of flow
                of a quantity called information. The world is subdivided by boundaries
                differentially permeable to information. Information is just that kind of
                quantifiable element (unit, basis of unity) which allows universal translation,
                and so unhindered instrumental power (called effective communication). The
                biggest threat to such power is interruption of communication. Any system
                breakdown is a function of stress. The fundamentals of this technology can
                be condensed into the metaphor C31, command-controlcommunication-intelligence,
                the military's symbol for its operations theory.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>In modern biologies, the translation of the world into a problem in coding
                can be illustrated by molecular genetics, ecology, sociobiological evolutionary
                theory, and immunobiology. The organism has been translated into prob-lems
                of genetic coding and read-out. Biotechnology, a writing technology, informs
                research broadly.14 In a sense, organisms have ceased to exist as objects
                of knowledge, giving way to biotic components, i.e., special kinds of information-processing
                devices. The analogous moves in ecology could be examined by probing the
                history and utility of the concept of the ecosystem. Immunobiology and associated
                medical practices are rich exemplars of the privilege of coding and recognition
                systems as objects of knowledge, as constructions of bodily reality for
                us. Biology here is a kind of cryptography. Research is necessarily a kind
                of intelligence activity. Ironies abound. A stressed system goes awry; its
                communication processes break down; it fails to recognize the difference
                between self and other. Human babies with</P>

                at least as much as for the guardians of human purity. In the US gay men
                and intravenous drug users are the 'privileged' victims of an awful immune
                system disease that marks (inscribes on the body) confusion of boundaries
                and moral pollution (Treichler, 1987).</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>But these excursions into communications sciences and biology have been
                at a rarefied level; there is a mundane, largely economic reality to support
                my claim that these sciences and technologies indicate fundamental transforma-tions
                in the structure of the world for us. Communications technologies depend
                on electronics. Modern states, multinational corporations, military power,
                welfare state apparatuses, satellite systems, political processes, fabrication
                of our imaginations, labour-control systems, medical construc-tions of our
                bodies, commercial pornography, the international division of labour, and
                religious evangelism depend intimately upon electronics. Micro-electronics
                is the technical basis of simulacra; that is, of copies without originals.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Microelectronics mediates the translations of labour into robotics and
                word processing, sex into genetic engineering and reproductive technologies,
                and mind into artificial intelligence and decision procedures. The new biotechnologies
                concern more than human reproducdon. Biology as a powerful engineering science
                for redesigning materials and processes has revolutionary implications for
                industry, perhaps most obvious today in areas of fermentadon, agriculture,
                and energy. Communicadons sciences and biology are construcdons of natural-technical
                objects of knowledge in which the difference between machine and organism
                is thoroughly blurred; mind, body, and tool are on very intimate terms.
                The 'multinational' material organization of the production and reproduction
                of daily life and the symbolic organization of the production and reproduction
                of culture and imagination seem equally implicated. The boundary-maintaining
                images of base and superstructure, public and private, or material and ideal
                never seemed more feeble.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>I have used Rachel Grossman's (1980) image of women in the integrated
                circuit to name the situation of women in a world so intimately restructured
                through the social relations of science and technology.15 I used the odd
                circumlocution, 'the social relations of science and technology', to indicate
                that we are not dealing with a technological determinism, but with a historical
                system depending upon structured relations among people. But the phrase
                should also indicate that science and technology provide fresh sources of
                power, that we need fresh sources of analysis and political action (Latour,
                1984). Some of the rearrangements of race, sex, and class rooted in high-tech-facilitated
                social relations can make socialist-feminism more relevant to effective
                progressive politics.</P>

            <P>THE 'HOMEWORK ECONOMY' OUTSIDE 'THE HOME'</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The 'New Industrial Revolution' is producing a new world-wide working
                class, as well as new sexualities and ethnicities. The extreme mobility
                of capital and the emerging international division of labour are intertwined
                with the emergence of new collecdvities, and the weakening of familiar groupings.
                These developments are neither gender- nor race-neutral. White men in advanced
                industrial societies have become newly vulnerable to permanent job loss,
                and women are not disappearing from the job rolls at the same rates as men.
                It is not simply that women in Third World countries are the preferred labour
                force for the science-based multinationals in the export-processing sectors,
                particularly in electronics. The picture is more systematic and involves
                reproduction, sexuality, culture, consumphon, and producdon. In the prototypical
                Silicon Valley, many women's lives have been structured around employment
                in electronics-dependent jobs, and their intimate realities include serial
                heterosexual monogamy, negotiating childcare, distance from extended kin
                or most other forms of traditional community, a high likelihood of loneliness
                and extreme economic vulnerability as they age. The ethnic and racial diversity
                of women in Silicon Valley structures a microcosm of conflicting differences
                in culture, family, religion, education, and language.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Richard Gordon has called this new situation the 'homework economy'.16
                Although he includes the phenomenon of literal homework emerging in connecdon
                with electronics assembly, Gordon intends 'homework economy' to name a restructuring
                of work that broadly has the characteristics formerly ascribed to female
                jobs, jobs literally done only by women. Work is being redefined as both
                literally female and feminized, whether performed by men or women. To be
                feminized means to be made extremely vulnerable; able to be disassembled,
                reassembled, exploited as a reserve labour force; seen less as workers than
                as servers; subjected to dme arrangements on and off the paid job that make
                a mockery of a limited work day; leading an existence that always borders
                on being obscene, out of place, and reducible to sex. Deskilling is an old
                strategy newly applicable to formerly privileged workers. However, the homework
                economy does not refer only to large-scale deskilling, nor does it deny
                that new areas of high skill are emerging, even for women and men previously
                excluded from skilled employment. Rather, the concept indicates that factory,
                home, and market are integrated on a new scale and that the places of women
                are crucial - and need to be analysed for differences among women and for
                meanings for relations between men and women in various situations.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The homework economy as a world capitalist organizational structure is
                made possible by (not caused by) the new technologies. The success of the
                attack on relatively privileged, mostly white, men's unionized jobs is deaf
                to</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>167</P>

            <P>the power of the new communications technologies to integrate and control
                labour despite extensive dispersion and decentralization. The consequences
                of the new technologies are felt by women both in the loss of the family
                (male) wage (if they ever had access to this white privilege) and in the
                character of their own jobs, which are becoming capital-intensive; for example,
                office work and nursing.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The new economic and technological arrangements are also related to the
                collapsing welfare state and the ensuing intensification of demands on women
                to sustain daily life for themselves as well as for men, children, and old
                people. The feminization of poverty-- generated by dismantling the welfare
                state, by the homework economy where stable jobs become the exception, and
                sustained by the expectation that women's wages will not be matched by a
                male income for the support of children-- has become an urgent focus. The
                causes of various women-headed households are a function of race, class,
                or sexuality; but their increasing generality is a ground for coalitions
                of women on many issues. That women regularly sustain daily life partly
                as a funcdon of their enforced status as mothers is hardly new; the kind
                of integration with the overall capitalist and progressively war-based economy
                is new. The particular pressure, for example, on US black women, who have
                achieved an escape from (barely) paid domeshc service and who now hold clerical
                and similar jobs in large numbers, has large implicadons for condnued enforced
                black poverty with employment. Teenage women in industrializing areas of
                the Third World increasingly find themselves the sole or major source of
                a cash wage for their families, while access to land is ever more problemadc.
                These developments must have major consequences in the psychodynamics and
                politics of gender and race.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Within the framework of three major stages of capitalism (commercial/
                early industrial, monopoly, multinational) --tied to nationalism, imperialism,
                and multinationalism, and related to Jameson's three dominant aesthetic
                periods of realism, modernism, and postmodernism --I would argue that specific
                forms of families dialectically relate to forms of capital and to its political
                and cultural concomitants. Although lived problematically and unequally,
                ideal forms of these families might be schematized as (1) the patriarchal
                nuclear family, structured by the dichotomy between public and private and
                accompanied by the white bourgeois ideology of separate spheres and nineteenth-century
                Anglo-American bourgeois feminism; (2) the modern family mediated (or enforced)
                by the welfare state and institutions like the family wage, with a flowering
                of a-feminist heterosexual ideologies, including their radical versions
                represented in Greenwich Village around the First World War; and (3) the
                'family' of the homework economy with its oxymoronic structure of women-headed
                households and its explosion of feminisms and the paradoxical intensification
                and erosion of gender itself.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>168</P>

            <P>This is the context in which the projections for world-wide structural
                unemployment stemming from the new technologies are part of the picture
                of the homework economy. As robodcs and related technologies put men out
                of work in 'developed' countries and exacerbate failure to generate male
                jobs in Third World 'development', and as the automated of fice becomes
                the rule even in labour-surplus countries, the feminization of work intensifies.
                Black women in the United States have long known what it looks like to face
                the structural underemployment ('feminization') of black men, as well as
                their own highly vulnerable position in the wage economy. It is no longer
                a secret that sexuality, reproduction, family, and community life are interwoven
                with this economic structure in myriad ways which have also differentiated
                the situations of white and black women. Many more women and men will contend
                with similar situations, which will make cross-gender and race alliances
                on issues of basic life support (with or without jobs) necessary, not just
                mice.</P>

            <P>The new technologies also have a profound effect on hunger and on food
                production for subsistence world-wide. Rae Lessor Blumberg (1983) estimates
                that women produce about 50 per cent of the world's subsistence food.17
                Women are excluded generally from benefiting from the increased high-tech
                commodification of food and energy crops, their days are made more arduous
                because their responsibilides to provide food do not diminish, and their
                reproductive situations are made more complex. Green Revolution technologies
                interact with other high-tech industrial production to alter gender divisions
                of labour and differential gender migration patterns.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The new technologies seem deeply involved in the forms of'privatization'
                that Ros Petchesky (1981) has analysed, in which militarization, right-wing
                family ideologies and policies, and intensified definitions of corporate
                (and state) property as private synergistically interact.18 The new communications
                technologies are fundamental to the eradication of 'public life' for everyone.
                This facilitates the mushrooming of a permanent high-tech military establishment
                at the cultural and economic expense of most people, but especially of women.
                Technologies like video games and highly miniaturized televi-sions seem
                crucial to production of modern forms of 'private life'. The culture of
                video games is heavily orientated to individual compedtion and extraterrestrial
                warfare. High-tech, gendered imaginations are produced here, imaginations
                that can contemplate destruction of the planet and a sci-fi escape from
                its consequences. More than our imaginations is militarized; and the other
                realities of electronic and nuclear warfare are inescapable. These are the
                technologies that promise ultimate mobility and perfect exchange-- and incidentally
                enable tourism, that perfect practice of mobility and exchange, to emerge
                as one of the world's largest single industries.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The new technologies affect the social relations of both sexuality and
                of</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>169</P>

            <P>reproduction, and not always in the same ways. The close ties of sexuality
                and instrumentality, of views of the body as a kind of private satisfaction-
                and utility-maximizing machine, are described nicely in sociobiological
                origin stories that stress a genetic calculus and explain the inevitable
                dialectic of domination of male and female gender roles.19 These sociobiological
                stories depend on a high-tech view of the body as a biotic component or
                cybernetic communications system. Among the many transformations of reproductive
                situations is the medical one, where women's bodies have boundaries newly
                permeable to both 'visualization' and 'intervention'. Of course, who controls
                the interpretation of bodily boundaries in medical hermeneubcs is a major
                feminist issue. The speculum served as an icon of women's claiming their
                bodies in the 1970S; that handcraft tool is inadequate to express our needed
                body politics in the negotiation of reality in the practices of cyborg reproduction.
                Self-help is not enough. The technologies of visualization recall the important
                cultural practice of hundng with the camera and the deeply predatory nature
                of a photographic consciousness.20 Sex, sexuality, and reproduction are
                central actors in high-tech myth systems structuring our imaginations of
                personal and social possibility.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Another critical aspect of the social relations of the new technologies
                is the reformulation of expectations, culture, work, and reproduction for
                the large scientific and technical work-force. A major social and political
                danger is the formation of a strongly bimodal social structure, with the
                masses of women and men of all ethnic groups, but especially people of colour,
                confined to a homework economy, illiteracy of several varieties, and general
                redundancy and impotence, controlled by high-tech repressive apparatuses
                ranging from entertainment to surveillance and disappearance. An adequate
                socialist-feminist politics should address women in the privileged occupational
                categories, and particularly in the production of science and technology
                that constructs scientific-technical discourses, processes, and objects.21</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>This issue is only one aspect of enquiry into the possibility of a feminist
                science, but it is important. What kind of constitutive role in the production
                of knowledge, imagination, and practice can new groups doing science have?
                How can these groups be allied with progressive social and political movements?
                What kind of political accountability can be constructed to the women together
                across the scientific-technical hierarchies separating us? Might there be
                ways of developing feminist science/technology politics in alliance with
                and-military science facility conversion action groups? Many sciendfic and
                technical workers in Silicon Valley, the high-tech cowboys included, do
                not want to work on military science.22 Can these personal preferences and
                cultural tendencies be welded into progressive politics among this professional
                middle class in which women, including women of colour, are coming to be
                fairly numerous?</P>

            <P>WOMEN IN THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Let me summarize the picture of women's historical locations in advanced
                industrial societies, as these positions have been restructured partly through
                the social relations of science and technology. If it was ever possible
                ideologically to characterize women's lives by the disdnction of public
                and private domains-- suggested by images of the division of working-class
                life into factory and home, of bourgeois life into market and home, and
                of gender existence into personal and political realms --it is now a totally
                misleading ideology, even to show how both terms of these dichotomies construct
                each other in practice and in theory. I prefer a network ideological image,
                suggesting the profusion of spaces and identities and the permeability of
                boundaries in the personal body and in the body politic. 'Networking' is
                both a feminist practice and a multinational corporate strategy -- weaving
                is for oppositional cyborgs.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>So let me return to the earlier image of the informatics of domination
                and trace one vision of women's 'place' in the integrated circuit, touching
                only a few idealized social locations seen primarily from the point of view
                of advanced capitalist societies: Home, Market, Paid Work Place, State,
                School, Clinic-Hospital, and Church. Each of these idealized spaces is logically
                and practically implied in every other locus, perhaps analogous to a holographic
                photograph. I want to suggest the impact of the social relations mediated
                and enforced by the new technologies in order to help formulate needed analysis
                and practical work. However, there is no 'place' for women in these networks,
                only geometries of difference and contradiction crucial to women's cyborg
                identities. If we learn how to read these webs of power and social life,
                we might learn new couplings, new coalitions. There is no way to read the
                following list from a standpoint of'idendfication', of a unitary self. The
                issue is dispersion. The task is to survive in the diaspora.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The only way to characterize the informatics of domination is as a massive
                intensification of insecurity and cultural impoverishment, with common failure
                of subsistence networks for the most vulnerable. Since much of this picture
                interweaves with the social relations of science and technology, the urgency
                of a socialist-feminist politics addressed to science and technology is
                plain. There is much now being tione, and the grounds for political work
                are rich. For example, the efforts to develop forms of collecdve struggle
                for women in paid work, like SEIU's District 925,* should be a high priority
                for all of us. These efforts are profoundly deaf to technical restructuring
                of labour processes and reformations of working classes. These efforts also
                are providing understanding of a more comprehensive kind of labour organization,
                involving community, sexuality, and family issues never privileged in the
                largely white male industrial unions.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The structural rearrangements related to the social relations of science
                and technology evoke strong ambivalence. But it is not necessary to be uldmately
                depressed by the implications of late twentieth-century women's relation
                to all aspects of work, culture, production of knowledge, sexuality, and
                reproduction. For excellent reasons, most Marxisms see domination best and
                have trouble understanding what can only look like false consciousness and
                people's complicity in their own domination in late capitalism. It is crucial
                to remember that what is lost, perhaps especially from women's points of
                view, is often virulent forms of oppression, nostalgically naturalized in
                the face of current violation. Ambivalence towards the disrupted unides
                mediated by high-tech culture requires not sorting consciousness into categories
                of clear-sighted critique grounding a solid political epistemology'</P>

            <P>There are grounds for hope in the emerging bases for new kinds of unity
                across race, gender, and class, as these elementary units of socialist-feminist
                analysis themselves suffer protean transformations. Intensifications of
                hardship experienced world-wide in connection with the social relations
                of science and technology are severe. But what people are experiencing is
                not transparently clear, and we lack aufficiently subtle connections for
                collectively building effective theories of experience. Present efforts
                - Marxist, psychoanalytic, feminist, anthropological-- to clarify even 'our'
                experience are rudimentary.</P>

            <P>I am conscious of the odd perspecdve provided by my historical position
                - a PhD in biology for an Irish Catholic girl was made possible by Sputnik's
                impact on US national science-education policy. I have a body and mind as
                much constructed by the post-Second World War arms race and cold war as
                by the women's movements. There are more grounds for hope in focusing on
                the contradictory effects of politics designed to produce loyal American
                technocrats, which also produced large numbers of dissidents, than in focusing
                on the present defeats.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The permanent pardality of feminist points of view has consequences for
                our expectations of forms of political organization and participation. We
                do not need a totality in order to work well. The feminist dream of a common
                language, like all dreams for a perfectly true language, of perfectly faithful
                naming of experience, is a totalizing and imperialist one. In that sense,
                dialectics too is a dream language, longing to resolve contradiction. Perhaps,
                ironically, we can learn from our fusions with animals and machines how
                not to be Man, the embodiment of Western logos. From the point of view of
                pleasure in these potent and taboo fusions, made inevitable by the social
                relations of science and technology, there might indeed be a feminist science.</P>

            <P>CYBORGS: A MYTH OF POLITICAL IDENTITY</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>I want to conclude with a myth about idendty and boundaries which might
                inform late twentieth-century political imaginations (Plate 1). I am indebted
                in this story to writers like Joanna Russ, Samuel R. Delany, John Varley,
                James Tiptree, Jr, Octavia Butler, Monique Wittig, and Vonda McIntyre.23
                These are our story-tellers exploring what it means to be embodied in high-tech
                worlds. They are theorists for cyborgs. Exploring concephons of bodily boundaries
                and social order, the anthropologist Mary Douglas (1966, 1970) should be
                credited with helping us to consciousness about how fundamental body imagery
                is to world view, and so to political language.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>French feminists like Luce Irigaray and Monique Wittig, for all their
                differences, know how to write the body; how to weave eroticism, cosmology,
                and politics from imagery of embodiment, and especially for Wittig, from
                imagery of fragmentation and reconstitution of bodies.24</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>American radical feminists like Susan Griffnn, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne
                Rich have profoundly affected our political imaginations - and perhaps restricted
                too much what we allow as a friendly body and political language.25 They
                insist on the organic, opposing it to the technological. But their symbolic
                systems and the related positions of ecofeminism and feminist paganism,
                replete with organicisms, can only be understood in Sandoval's terms as
                oppositional ideologies fitting the late twentieth century. They would simply
                bewilder anyone not preoccupied with the machines and consciousness of late
                capitalism. In that sense they are part of the cyborg world. But there are
                also great riches for feminists in explicitly embracing the possibilides
                inherent in the breakdown of clean disdnctions between organism and machine
                and similar distinctions structuring the Western self. It is the simultaneity
                of breakdowns that cracks the matrices of domination and opens geometric
                possibilities. What might be learned from personal and political 'technological'
                pollution? I look briefly at two overlapping groups of texts for their insight
                into the construction of a potentially helpful cyborg myth: constructions
                of women of colour and monstrous selves in feminist science fiction.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Earlier I suggested that 'women of colour' might be understood as a cyborg
                idendty, a potent subjecdvity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities
                and in the complex political-historical layerings of her 'biomythography',
                Zami (Lorde, 1982; King, 1987a, 1987b). There are material and cultural
                grids mapping this potential, Audre Lorde (1984) captures the tone in the
                title of her Sister Outsider. In my political myth, Sister Outsider is the
                offshore woman, whom US workers, female and feminized, are supposed to regard
                as the enemy prevendug their solidarity, threatening their security. Onshore,
                inside the boundary of the United States, Sister Outsider is a potential
                amidst the races and ethnic identities of women manipulated for division,
                competition, and exploitation in the same industries. 'Women of colour'
                are the preferred labour force for the science-based industries, the real
                women for whom the world-wide sexual market, labour market, and politics
                of reproduction kaleidoscope into daily life. Young Korean women hired in
                the sex industry and in electronics assembly are recruited from high schools,
                educated for the integrated circuit. Literacy, especially in English, distinguishes
                the 'cheap' female labour so attractive to the multinationals.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Contrary to orientalist stereotypes of the 'oral primidve', literacy
                is a special mark of women of colour, acquired by US black women as well
                as</P>

            <P>men through a history of risking death to learn and to teach reading
                and wridng. Writing has a special significance for all colonized groups.
                Writing has been crucial to the Western myth of the distinction between
                oral and written cultures, primitive and civilized mentalities, and more
                recently to the erosion of that distinction in 'postmodernist' theories
                attacking the phallogo-centrism of the West, with its worship of the monotheistic,
                phallic, authoritative, and singular work, the unique and perfect name.26
                Contests for the meanings of writing are a major form of contemporary political
                struggle. Releasing the play of writing is deadly serious. The poetry and
                stories of US women of colour are repeatedly about writing, about access
                to the power to signify; but this dme that power must be neither phallic
                nor innocent. Cyborg writing must not be about the Fall, the imagination
                of a once-upon-a-time wholeness before language, before writing, before
                Man. Cyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original
                innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that
                marked them as other.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The tools are often stories, retold stories, versions that reverse and
                displace the hierarchical dualisms of naturalized identities. In retelling
                origin stories, cyborg authors subvert the central myths of origin of Western
                culture. We have all been colonized by those origin myths, with their longing
                for fulfilment in apocalypse. The phallogocentrie origin stories most crucial
                for feminist cyborgs are built into the literal technologies - teehnologies
                that write the world, biotechnology and microelectronics - that have recently
                textualized our bodies as code problems on the grid of C3I. Feminist cyborg
                stories have the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert
                command and control.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Figuratively and literally, language politics pervade the struggles of
                women of colour; and stories about language have a special power in the
                rich contemporary writing by US women of colour. For example, retellings
                of the stom~ of the indigenous woman Malinche, mother of the mesdzo 'bastard'
                race of the new world, master of languages, and mistress of Cortes, carry
                special meaning for Chicana constructions of identity. Cherrie Moraga (1983)
                in Loving in the War Years explores the themes of identity when one never
                possessed the original language, never told the original story, never resided
                in the harmony of legitimate heterosexuality in the garden of culture, and
                so cannot base identity on a myth or a fall from innocence and right to
                natural names, mother's or father's.27 Moraga's writing, her superb literacy,
                is presented in her poetry as the same kind of violation as Malinche's mastery
                of the conqueror's language -- a violation, an illegitimate production,
                that allows survival. Moraga's language is not 'whole'; it is self-consciously
                spliced, a chimera of English and Spanish, both conqueror's languages. But
                it is this chimeric monster, without claim to an original language before</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>176</P>

            <P>violation, that crafts the erode, competent, potent identities of women
                of colour. Sister Outsider hints at the possibility of world survival not
                because of her innocence, but because of her ability to live on the boundaries,
                to write without the founding myth of original wholeness, with its inescapable
                apocalypse of final return to a deathly oneness that Man has imagined to
                be the innocent and all-powerful Mother, freed at the End from another spiral
                of appropriation by her son. Writing marks Moraga's body, affirms it as
                the body of a woman of colour, against the possibility of passing into the
                unmarked category of the Anglo father or into the orientalist myth of 'original
                illiteracy' of a mother that never was. Malinche was mother here, not Eve
                before eating the forbidden fruit. Writing affirms Sister Outsider, not
                the Woman-before-the-Fall-into-Writing needed by the phallogocentric Family
                of Man.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Writing is pre-eminently the technology of cyborgs, etched surfaces of
                the late twentieth century. Cyborg politics is the struggle for language
                and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that
                translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism.
                That is why cyborg politics insist on noise and advocate pollution, rejoicing
                in the illegitimate fusions of animal and machine. These are the couplings
                which make Man and Woman so problematic, subverting the structure of desire,
                the force imagined to generate language and gender, and so subverting the
                structure and modes of reproduction of 'Western' idendty, of nature and
                culture, of mirror and eye, slave and master, body and mind. 'We' did not
                originally choose to be cyborgs, but choice grounds a liberal politics and
                epistemology that imagines the reproduction of individuals before the wider
                replications of 'texts'.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>From the perspective of cyborgs, freed of the need to ground politics
                in 'our' privileged position of the oppression that incorporates all other
                dominations, the innocence of the merely violated, the ground of those closer
                to nature, we can see powerful possibilities. Feminisms and Marxisms have
                run aground on Western epistemological imperatives to construct a revolutionary
                subject from the perspective of a hierarchy of oppressions and/or a latent
                position of moral superiority, innocence, and greater closeness to nature.
                With no available original dream of a common language or original symbiosis
                promising protection from hostile 'masculine' separation, but written into
                the play of a text that has no finally privileged reading or salvation history,
                to recognize 'oneself' as fully implicated in the world, frees us of the
                need to root politics in identification, vanguard parties, purity, and mothering.
                Stripped of identity, the bastard race teaches about the power of the margins
                and the importance of a mother like Malinche. Women of colour have transformed

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>This is not just literary deconstruction, but liminal transformation.
                Every, story that begins with original innocence and privileges the return
                to wholeness imagines the drama of life to be individuation, separation,
                the birth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall into writing, alienation;
                that is, war, tempered by imaginary respite in the bosom of the Other. These
                plots are ruled by a reproductive politics --rebirth without flaw, perfection,
                abstraction. In this plot women are imagined either better or worse off,
                but all agree they have less selflhood, weaker individuation, more fusion
                to the oral, to Mother, less at stake in masculine autonomy. But there is
                another route to having less at stake in masculine autonomy, a route that
                does not pass through Woman, Primitive, Zero, the Mirror Stage and its imaginaw.
                It passes through women and other present-tense, illegitimate cyborgs, not
                of Woman born, who refuse the ideological resources of victimization so
                as to have a real life. These cyborgs are the people who refuse to disappear
                on cue, no matter how many dmes a 'western' commentator remarks on the sad
                passing of another primitive, another organic group done in by 'Western'
                technology, by writing.28 These real-life cyborgs (for example, the Southeast
                Asian village women workers inJapanese and US electronics firms described
                by Aihwa Ong) are actively rewriting the texts of their bodies and sociedes.
                Sumival is the stakes in this play of readings.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>To recapitulate, certain dualisms have been persistent in Western traditions;
                they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of domination of
                women, people of colour, nature, workers, animals - in short, domination
                of all constituted as others, whose task is to mirror the self. Chief among
                these troubling dualisms are self/other, mind/body, culture/nature, male/female,
                civilized/primitive, reality/appearance, whole/part, agent/resource, maker/
                made, active/passive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, totaVpartial, God/man.
                The self is the One who is not dominated, who knows that by the semice of
                the other, the other is the one who holds the future, who knows that by
                the experience of domination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the
                self. To be One is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be
                One is to be an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse
                with the other. Yet to be other is to be multiple, without clear boundary,
                frayed, insubstantial. One is too few, but two are too many.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>High-tech culture challenges these dualisms in intriguing ways. It is
                not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and machine.
                It is not clear what is mind and what body in machines that resolve into
                coding practices. In so far as we know ourselves in both formal discourse
                (for example, biology) and in daily practice (for example, the homework
                economy in the integrated circuit), we find ourselves to be cyborgs, hybrids,
                mosaics, chimeras. Biological organisms have become biotic systems, com-</P>

            <P>178</P>

            <P>munications devices like others. There is no fundamental, ontological
                separation in our formal knowledge of machine and organism, of technical
                and organic. The replicant Rachel in the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner
                stands as the image of a cyborg culture's fear, love, and confusion.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>One consequence is that our sense of connection to our tools is heightened.
                The trance state experienced by many computer users has become a staple
                of science-fiction film and cultural jokes. Perhaps paraplegics and other
                severely handicapped people can (and sometimes do) have the most intense
                experiences of complex hybridization with other communication devices.29
                Anne McCaffrey's pre-feminist The Ship Who Sang (1969) explored the consciousness
                of a cyborg, hybrid of girl's brain and complex machinery, formed after
                the birth of a severely handicapped child. Gender, sexuality, embodiment,
                skill: all were reconstituted in the story. Why should our bodies end at
                the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin? From the
                seventeenth century dll now, machines could be animated - given ghostly
                souls to make them speak or move or to account for their orderly development
                and mental capacides. Or organisms could be mechan-ized - reduced to body
                understood as resource of mind. These machine/ organism relationships are
                obsolete, unnecessary. For us, in imagination and in other practice, machines
                can be prosthetic devices, intimate components, friendly selves. We don't
                need organic holism to give impermeable whole-ness, the total woman and
                her feminist variants (mutants?). Let me conclude this point by a very partial
                reading of the logic of the cyborg monsters of my second group of texts,
                feminist science fiction.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The cyborgs populating feminist science fiction make very problematic
                the statuses of man or woman, human, artefact, member of a race, individual
                endty, or body. Katie King clarifies how pleasure in reading these fictions
                is not largely based on idendfication. Students facingJoanna Russ for the
                first time, students who have learned to take modernist writers like James
                Joyce or Virginia Woolf without flinching, do not know what to make of The
                Adventures of Alyx or The Female Man, where characters refuse the reader's
                search for innocent wholeness while granting the wish for heroic quests,
                exuberant eroticism, and serious politics. The Female Man is the story of
                four versions of one genotype, all of whom meet, but even taken together
                do not make a whole, resolve the dilemmas of violent moral action, or remove
                the growing scandal of gender. The feminist science fiction of Samuel R.
                Delany, especially Tales of Neveyon, mocks stories of origin by redoing
                the neolithic revolution, replaying the founding moves of Western civilization
                to subvert their plausibility. James Tiptree, Jr, an author whose fiction
                was regarded as particularly manly undl her 'true' gender was revealed,
                tells tales of reproduction based on non-mammalian technologies like alternation
                of generations of male brood pouches and male nurturing. John Varley</P>

            <P>179</P>

            <P>constructs a supreme cyborg in his arch-feminist exploration of Gaea,
                a mad goddess-planet-trickster-old woman-technological device on whose surface
                an extraordinary array of post-cyborg symbioses are spawned. Octavia Butler
                writes of an African sorceress pithug her powers of transformation against
                the genetic manipulations of her rival (Wild Seed), of dme warps that bring
                a modern US black woman into slavery where her actions in relation to her
                white master-ancestor determine the possibility of her own birth (Kindred),
                and of the illegidmate insights into idendty and community of an adopted
                cross-species child who came to know the enem' as self (Survivor). In Dawn
                (1987), the first instalment of a series called Xenogenesis, Butler tells
                the story of Lilith Iyapo, whose personal name recalls Adam's first and
                repudiated wife and whose family name marks her status as the widow of the
                son of Nigerian immigrants to the US. A black woman and a mother whose child
                is dead, Lilith mediates the transformation of humanity through genetic
                exchange with extra-terrestrial lovers/rescuers/destroyers/genetic engineers,
                who reform earth's habitats after the nuclear holocaust and coerce surviving
                humans into intimate fusion with them. It is a novel that interrogates reproductive,
                linguishc, and nuclear politics in a mythic field structured by late twentieth-century
                race and gender.</P>

            <P>Because it is particularly rich in boundary transgressions, Vonda McIn-tyre's
                Superluminal can close this truncated catalogue of promising and dangerous
                monsters who help redefine the pleasures and politics of embodiment and
                feminist writing. In a fiction where no character is 'simply' human, human
                status is highly problematic. Orca, a genetically altered diver, can speak
                with killer whales and survive deep ocean conditions, but she longs to explore
                space as a pilot, necessitating bionic implants jeopardizing her kinship
                with the divers and cetaceans. Transformations are effected by virus vectors
                carrying a new developmental code, by transplant surgery, by implants of
                microelectronic devices, by analogue doubles, and other means. Lacnea becomes
                a pilot by accepting a heart implant and a host of other alterations allowing
                survival in transit at speeds exceeding that of light. Radu Dracul survives
                a virus-caused plague in his outerworld planet to find himself with a time
                sense that changes the boundaries of spatial perception for the whole species.
                All the characters explore the limits of language; the dream of communicating
                experience; and the necessity of limitation, partiality, and indmacy even
                in this world of protean transformation and connection. Superluminal stands
                also for the defining contradictions of a cyborg world in another sense;
                it embodies textually the intersection of feminist theory and colonial discourse
                in the science fiction I have alluded to in this chapter. This is a conjunction
                with a long history that many 'First World' feminists have tried to repress,
                including myself in my readings of Superluminal before being called to account
                by Zoe Sofoulis,</P>

            <P>180</P>

            <P>whose different location in the world system's informatics of domin-ation
                made her acutely alert to the imperialist moment of all science fiction
                cultures, including women's science fiction. From an Australian feminist
                sensitivity, Sofoulis remembered more readily McIntyre's role as writer
                of the adventures of Captain Kirk and Spock in TV's Star Trek series than
                her rewriting the romance in Superluminal.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Monsters have always defined the limits of community in Western imaginations.
                The Centaurs and Amazons of ancient Greece established the limits of the
                centred polls of the Greek male human by their disruption of marriage and
                boundary pollutions of the warrior with animality and woman. Unseparated
                twins and hermaphrodites were the confused human material in early modern
                France who grounded discourse on the natural and supernatural, medical and
                legal, portents and diseases -- all crucial to establishing modern identity.30
                The evolutionary and behavioural sciences of monkeys and apes have marked
                the multiple boundaries of late twentieth-century industrial identities.
                Cyborg monsters in feminist science fiction define quite different political
                possibilities and limits from those proposed by the mundane fiction of Man
                and Woman.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>There are several consequences to taking seriously the imagery of cyborgs
                as other than our enemies. Our bodies, ourselves; bodies are maps of power
                and identity. Cyborgs are no exception. A cyborg body is not innocent; it
                was not born in a garden; it does not seek unitary identity and so generate
                antagonistic dualisms without end (or until the world ends); it takes irony
                for granted. One is too few, and two is only one possibility. Intense pleasure
                in skill, machine skill, ceases to be a sin, but an aspect of embodiment.
                The machine is not an it to be animated, worshipped, and dominated. The
                machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible
                for machines; they do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for
                boundaries; we are they. Up till now (once upon a time), female embodiment
                seemed to be given, organic, necessary; and female embodiment seemed to
                mean skill in mothering and its metaphoric exten-sions. Only by being out
                of place could we take intense pleasure in machines, and then with excuses
                that this was organic activity after all, appropriate to females. Cyborgs
                might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex
                and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be global identity after all, even
                if it has profound historical breadth and depth.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>The ideologically charged question of what counts as daily activity,
                as experience, can be approached by exploiting the cyborg image. Feminists
                have recently claimed that women are given to dailiness, that women more
                than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemo-logical
                position potentially. There is a compelling aspect to this claim, one that
                makes visible unvalued female activity and names it as the ground of life.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>181</P>

            <P>But the ground of life? What about all the ignorance of women, all the
                exclusions and failures of knowledge and skill? What about men's access
                to daily competence, to knowing how to build things, to take them apart,
                to play? What about other embodiments? Cyborg gender is a local possibility
                taking a global vengeance. Race, gender, and capital require a cyborg theory
                of wholes and parts. There is no drive in cyborgs to produce total theory,
                but there is an intimate experience of boundaries, their construction and
                deconstruction. There is a myth system waiting to become a political language
                to ground one way of looking at science and technology and challenging the
                informatics of domination-- in order to act potently.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>One last image organisms and organismic, holistic politics depend on
                metaphors of rebirth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive
                sex. I would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration and
                are suspicious of the reproductive matrix and of most birthing. For salamanders,
                regeneration after injury, such as the loss of a limb, involves regrowth
                of structure and restoration of function with the constant possibility of
                twinning or other odd topographical productions at the site of former injury.
                The regrown limb can be monstrous, duplicated, potent. We have all been
                injured, profoundly. We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibilities
                for our reconstitution include the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous
                world without gender.</P>

            <P>&nbsp;</P>

            <P>Cyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments in this essay:
                first, the production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake
                that misses most of reality, probably always, but certainly now; and second,
                taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology
                means refusing an anti-science metaphysics, a demonology of technology,
                and so means embracing the skilful task of reconstructing the boundaries
                of daily life, in partial connection with others, in communication with
                all of our parts. It is not just that science and technology are possible
                means of great human satisfaction, as well as a matrix of complex dominations.
                Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we
                have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves. This is a dream not
                of a common language, but of a powerful infidel heteroglossia. It is an
                imagination of a feminist speaking in tongues to strike fear into the circuits
                of the supersavers of the new right. It means both building and destroying
                machines, identities, categories, relationships, space stories. Though both
                are bound in the spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess.</P>
