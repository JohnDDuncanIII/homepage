                <P>
                    "Lowtech" means technology that is cheap or free.
                </P>

                <P>
                    Technology moves on so fast that right now we can
                    recover low-end Pentiums and fast Macintoshes from the
                    trash. Lowtech upgrades every year. But we don't have to
                    pay for it.
                </P>

                <P>
                    Lowtech includes hardware and software. We advocate
                    freeware and low cost software. We particularly advocate
                    the use of low cost, open source operating systems.
                </P>

                <P>
                    High technology doesn't mean high creativity. In fact
                    sometimes the restrictions of a medium lead to the most
                    creative solutions.
                </P>

                <P>
                    Independence is important. Don't lock your creativity
                    into a box you don't control.
                </P>

                <P>
                    Access is important. Don't lock your creativity into a
                    format we can't see.
                </P>

                <P>
                    High tech artworks market new PCs. Even if they aren't
                    meant to. Artworks that make use of new, expensive
                    technology can't avoid being, in part, sales
                    demonstrations. Part of the message of an online video
                    stream, whatever its content, is &quot;Hey, isn't it time
                    for an upgrade?&quot;.
                </P>

                <P>
                    Communicators concerned with the meaning and context of
                    what they do may want to avoid this.
                </P>

                <P>
                    We're skeptical about the consumerist frenzy associated
                    with information technology. Lowtech questions the two
                    year upgrade cycle.
                </P>

                <P>
                    A lot of people say that new media is revolutionary.
                    They say the net is anarchic and subversive. But how
                    subversive can you be in an exclusive club, with a
                    $1000 entrance fee?
                </P>

                <P>
                    Lowtech counters exclusivity. Lowtech is street level
                    technology.
                </P>

                <P>
                    Text is great for communicating. Write down what you
                    want to say. Make it clear and simple and non-exclusive.
                </P>

                <P>
                    Email is still the &quot;killer app&quot;. Fast, low cost
                    global communication for the ordinary citizen is
                    genuinely something new.
                </P>

                <P>
                    HTML is good for lots more than web pages. Now you can
                    author all sorts of graphical stuff with a plain text editor.
                </P>

                <P>
                    Use the web for plain text and images. It's simple and
                    cheap and quick and it works.
                </P>
