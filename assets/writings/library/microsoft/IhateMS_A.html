<h2>Appendix A: A brief overview of Windows' most
  serious design flaws</h2>

<p>The Windows architecture has many design flaws that no amount of patching
or updating can ever remedy. Readers of this paper have indicated the need
for a brief summary.<br />
The following list is by no means comprehensive, but only summarizes the most
serious structural shortcomings that cripple the Windows operating system.</p>


<h3>Limited memory protection and memory management.</h3>
<p>This problem exists primarily in versions prior to Windows 2000. When an
application contains bugs or otherwise runs wild, it may write to memory
locations outside its own memory space, thereby crashing the entire system.
Attempts to allocate more memory than is available often generates an
exception, causing the application to crash instead of allowing it to recover
gracefully. Similarly, out-of-boundary reads are also possible, which
potentially compromises security.</p>

<h3>Insufficient process management.</h3>
<p>The OS relies heavily upon the application to release allocated resources.
If an application hogs resources or fails to release them for some reason,
either while running or upon termination, the OS often cannot reclaim those
resources. Nor does the OS offer an administrator full control over processes
and resources.</p>

<h3>No adequate separation between user-level and kernel-level code.</h3>
<p>An application may install DLLs or drivers. This introduces essentially
uncertified, third-party code to the system, that may run at kernel-level,
i.e. completely unprotected. Applications may also introduce modifications
into the registry without any protection or verification whatsoever, which
may cause other applications or even the OS to crash. This seriously
compromises the reliability of the entire system. In fact Windows is the
only major operating system in the market that may break whenever a user
installs an application (essentially a user-level operation). In Windows
2000 and later a simple driver signature system has finally been
implemented, but in practice this is not sufficient to guarantee
stability.</p>

<h3>No adequate separation of different kernel-level code types.</h3>
<p>Drivers, for example, should contain driver code. They should offer the OS
an API to interface with the underlying hardware. In Windows however a
video driver may also contain virtual desktop code and other nonsense. Not
only does the presence of user interface code in a hardware driver
illustrate the messy nature of the Windows code's organisation, but it
also leads to ridiculous issues such as system tray icons disappearing due
to a bug in the video card's driver. (Nvidia comes to mind.) In a
well-structured OS this would never happen.</p>

<h3>Lack of meaningful error messages.</h3>
<p>Whenever an error message is displayed, it rarely tells you exactly what
the problem is. Nor does it give you enough details (e.g. an error or
condition number) that would enable a support technician to trace the cause
of a problem.</p>

<h3>No maintenance mode.</h3>
<p>When one or more of the 10,000+ files that make up the OS become corrupted,
there is no maintenance mode that allows you to bring up the OS in a
controlled state, doing repairs along the way. 'Safe mode' merely swaps
configurations but offers little additional control. The OS either runs or
crashes. The Windows 2000/XP Repair Console (an external utility on the
Windows CD that may be run from the setup routine) does not allow you to run
the OS in a maintenance mode, it merely allows you to access the file system
of a broken Windows installation. Even finding out which files have been
corrupted is often impossible.</p>

<h3>No code sharing.</h3>
<p>Only DLL code can be shared, which makes up only a tiny fraction of the
entire OS and application code.</p>

<h3>No version control whatsoever on DLL code.</h3>
<p>The OS cannot distinguish one DLL from another one with the same name, even
though they may contain entirely different code. Installers can, but generally
don't bother with it (beyond warning the user that version x is about to be
replaced with version y). The OS however will happily load whatever code
is present in the DLL file it happens to find first.</p>

<h3>A very rudimentary and weak security model.</h3>
<p>Microsoft products have the worst security rating (and track record) in the
industry. Their developers seem to have been completely unaware of even basic
security issues.</p>

<h3>Rudimentary multi-user support.</h3>
<p>Being the offspring of a stand-alone, single-user desktop OS, Windows can
only be implemented in a LAN (or any other environment where users share
computing facilities) by means of cumbersome workarounds and kludges.
Multi-user applications (e.g. Citrix, Windows Terminal Server) are even more
problematic.</p>

<h3>OS code, application code and user data cannot be maintained
  separately from the OS and from each other.</h3>
<p>The OS is actually designed to prevent this. Applications need to be
&quot;installed&quot; i.e. integrated into the OS, a procedure that adds to
or even overwrites part the OS fileset, may overwrite other application files
or (registry) settings, and usually requires an OS reboot. The installation
of one application may break another application.</p>
<!-- For example, installing Netscape 6 on Windows 2000 will break -->
<!-- Forte Agent and SecureCRT  due to registry modifications.     -->

<h3>Windows does not follow global protocol standards correctly.</h3>
<p>It even deliberately ignores them in favor of proprietary
implementations.</p>

<h3>Windows' API is only partially documented.</h3>
<p>Much of the operating system and the API remain essentially a black box to
third-party developers. This causes problems during application development
that often cannot be traced. Developers are forced to use workarounds, and may
even be tempted to circumvent or ignore the API altogether. This, and the
fact that nobody outside Microsoft really knows what goes on in the
underlying code, leads to application software that won't run correctly
(if at all) on updated or new versions of Windows.</p>

<h3>Windows' code is a collection of bad programming practices.</h3>
<p>It contains a huge amount of sloppy code and kludgy design, which results
in an extremely glitchy and buggy end product. (A good example of sloppy
programming is buffer access, which is routinely left unchecked in release
versions of all Microsoft products. As a result of this amateur approach,
Microsoft products are riddled with buffer overrun vulnerabilities. Of
course buffer overruns don't only occur in Microsoft products but are also
found in other software on other platforms. But the difference is in the
numbers.) Bloated code has made Windows' efficiency the lowest in the
market, requiring more resources and yielding less performance than any
other OS in existence.</p>
