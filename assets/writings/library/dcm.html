            A Spectre is haunting multinational capitalism--the spectre
            of free information.  All the powers of ``globalism'' have entered
            into an unholy alliance to exorcize this spectre: Microsoft and
            Disney, the World Trade Organization, the United States Congress and
            the European Commission.  

        <P>
            Where are the advocates of freedom in the new digital society who have
            not been decried as pirates, anarchists, communists?  Have we not seen
            that many of those hurling the epithets were merely thieves in power,
            whose talk of ``intellectual property'' was nothing more than an
            attempt to retain unjustifiable privileges in a society irrevocably
            changing?  But it is acknowledged by all the Powers of Globalism that
            the movement for freedom is itself a Power, and it is high time that
            we should publish our views in the face of the whole world, to meet
            this nursery tale of the Spectre of Free Information with a Manifesto
            of our own.

        <P>

        <P>
            Throughout the world the movement for free information announces the
            arrival of a new social structure, born of the transformation of
            bourgeois industrial society by the digital technology of its
            own invention.  

        <P>
            The history of all hitherto existing societies reveals a history of
            class struggles.

        <P>
            Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master
            and journeyman, bourgeois and proletarian, imperialist and subaltern,
            in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to
            one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight,
            a fight that has often ended, either in a revolutionary
            re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the
            contending classes.

        <P>
            The industrial society that sprouted from the worldwide expansion of
            European power ushering in modernity did not do away with class
            antagonisms.  It but established new classes, new conditions of
            oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.  But the
            epoch of the bourgeoisie simplified the class antagonisms.  Society as
            a whole seemed divided into two great hostile camps, into two great
            classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

        <P>
            But revolution did not by and large occur, and the ``dictatorship of
            the proletariat,'' where it arose or claimed to arise, proved
            incapable of instituting freedom.  Instead, capitalism was enabled by
            technology to secure for itself a measure of consent.  The modern
            laborer in the advanced societies rose with the progress of industry,
            rather than sinking deeper and deeper below the conditions of
            existence of his own class.  Pauperism did not develop more rapidly
            than population and wealth.  Rationalized industry in the Fordist
            style turned industrial workers not into a pauperized proletariat, but
            rather into mass consumers of mass production.  Civilizing the
            proletariat became part of the self-protective program of the
            bourgeoisie.

        <P>
            In this way, universal education and an end to the industrial
            exploitation of children became no longer the despised program of the
            proletarian revolutionary, but the standard of bourgeois social
            morality.  With universal education, workers became literate in the
            media that could stimulate them to additional consumption.  The
            development of sound recording, telephony, moving pictures, and radio
            and television broadcasting changed the workers' relationship to
            bourgeois culture, even as it profoundly altered the culture itself.

        <P>
            Music, for example, throughout previous human history was an acutely
            perishable non-commodity, a social process, occurring in a place and
            at a time, consumed where it was made, by people who were indistinctly
            differentiated as consumers and as makers.  After the adoption of
            recording, music was a non-persishable commodity that could be moved
            long distances and was necessarily alienated from those who made it.
            Music became, as an article of consumption, an opportunity for its new
            ``owners'' to direct additional consumption, to create wants on the
            part of the new mass consuming class, and to drive its demand in
            directions profitable to ownership.  So too with the entirely new medium
            of the moving picture, which within decades reoriented the nature of
            human cognition, capturing a substantial fraction of every worker's
            day for the reception of messages ordering additional consumption.
            Tens of thousands of such advertisements passed before the eyes of
            each child every year, reducing to a new form of serfdom the children
            liberated from tending a productive machine: they were now
            compulsorily enlisted in tending the machinery of consumption.

        <P>
            Thus the conditions of bourgeois society were made less narrow, better
            able to comprise the wealth created by them.  Thus was cured the
            absurd epidemic of recurrent over-production.  No longer was there too
            much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry,
            too much commerce.

        <P>
            But the bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising
            the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of
            production, and with them the whole relations of society. Constant
            revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social
            conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the
            bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones.  All fixed, fast-frozen
            relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and
            opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before
            they can ossify.  All that is solid melts into air.

        <P>
            With the adoption of digital technology, the system of mass consumer
            production supported by mass consumer culture gave birth to new social
            conditions out of which a new structure of class antagonism
            precipitates.  

        <P>
            The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of
            production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws
            all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation. The cheap
            prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it
            batters down all Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians'
            intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate.  It compels
            all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt its culture and its
            principles of intellectual ownership; it compels them to introduce
            what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to become bourgeois
            themselves.  In one word, it creates a world after its own image.  But
            the very instruments of its communication and acculturation establish
            the modes of resistance which are turned against itself.

        <P>
            Digital technology transforms the bourgeois economy.  The dominant
            goods in the system of production--the articles of cultural
            consumption that are both commodities sold and instructions to the
            worker on what and how to buy--along with all other forms of culture
            and knowledge now have zero marginal cost.  Anyone and everyone may
            have the benefit of all works of culture: music, art, literature,
            technical information, science, and every other form of knowledge.
            Barriers of social inequality and geographic isolation dissolve.  In
            place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we
            have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of
            people.  And as in material, so also in intellectual production.  The
            intellectual creations of individual people become common property.
            Modern bourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange
            and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of
            production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer's apprentice, who is
            no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has
            called up by his spells.  

        <P>
            With this change, man is at last compelled to face with sober senses
            his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.  Society
            confronts the simple fact that when everyone can possess every
            intellectual work of beauty and utility--reaping all the human value
            of every increase of knowledge--at the same cost that any one person
            can possess them, it is no longer moral to exclude.  If Rome
            possessed the power to feed everyone amply at no greater cost than
            that of Caesar's own table, the people would sweep Caesar violently
            away if anyone were left to starve.  But the bourgeois system of
            ownership demands that knowledge and culture be rationed by the
            ability to pay.  Alternative traditional forms, made newly viable by
            the technology of interconnection, comprising voluntary associations
            of those who create and those who support, must be forced into unequal
            competition with ownership's overwhelmingly powerful systems of mass
            communication.  Those systems of mass communication are in turn based
            on the appropriation of the people's common rights in the
            electromagnetic spectrum.  Throughout the digital society the classes
            of knowledge workers--artists, musicians, writers, students,
            technologists and others trying to gain in their conditions of life by
            copying and modifying information--are radicalized by the conflict
            between what they know is possible and what the ideology of the
            bourgeois compels them to accept.  Out of that discordance arises the
            consciousness of a new class, and with its rise to self-consciousness
            the fall of ownership begins.

        <P>
            The advance of digital society, whose involuntary promoter is the
            bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the creators, due to
            competition, by their revolutionary combination, due to association.
            Creators of knowledge, technology, and culture discover that they no
            longer require the structure of production based on ownership and the
            structure of distribution based on coercion of payment.  Association,
            and its anarchist model of propertyless production, makes possible the
            creation of free software, through which creators gain control of the
            technology of further production.<A NAME="tex2html2"
                                                HREF="#foot21"><strong>[1]</strong>&nbsp;</A> The network itself,
            freed of the control of broadcasters and other bandwidth owners,
            becomes the locus of a new system of distribution, based on
            association among peers without hierarchical control, which replaces
            the coercive system of distribution for all music, video, and other
            soft goods.  Universities, libraries, and related institutions become
            allies of the new class, interpreting their historic role as
            distributors of knowledge to require them to offer increasingly
            complete access to the knowledge in their stewardship to all people,
            freely.  The liberation of information from the control of ownership
            liberates the worker from his imposed role as custodian of the
            machine.  Free information allows the worker to invest her time not in
            the consumption of bourgeois culture, with its increasingly urgent
            invitations to sterile consumption, but in the cultivation of her mind
            and her skills.  Increasingly aware of her powers of creation, she
            ceases to be a passive participant in the systems of production and
            consumption in which bourgeois society entrapped her.

        <P>
            But the bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an
            end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations.  It has pitilessly
            torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his ``natural
            superiors,'' and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man
            than naked self-interest, than callous ``cash payment.''  It has
            drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of
            chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water
            of egotistical calculation.  It has resolved personal worth into
            exchange value.  And in place of the numberless and feasible chartered
            freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom--Free Trade.
            In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political
            illusions, naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.

        <P>
            Against the forthcoming profound liberation of the working classes,
            whose access to knowledge and information power now
            transcends their previous narrow role as consumers of mass culture,
            the system of bourgeois ownership therefore necessarily contends to
            its very last.  With its preferred instrument of Free Trade, ownership
            attempts to bring about the very crisis of over-production it once
            feared.  Desperate to entrap the creators in their role as waged
            consumers, bourgeois ownership attempts to turn material deprivation
            in some parts of the globe into a source of cheap goods with which to
            bribe back into cultural passivity not the barbarians, but its own
            most prized possession--the educated technological laborers of the
            most advanced societies.

        <P>
            At this stage the workers and creators still form an incoherent mass
            scattered over the whole globe, and remain broken up by their mutual
            competition.  Now and then the creators are victorious, but only for a
            time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate
            result, but in the ever-expanding union.  This union is helped on by
            the improved means of communication that are created by modern
            industry and that place the workers and creators of different
            localities in contact with one another.  It was just this contact that
            was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles, all of the same
            character, into one national struggle between classes.  But every
            class struggle is a political struggle.  And that union, to attain
            which the burghers of the Middle Ages, with their miserable highways,
            required centuries, the modern knowledge workers, thanks to the
            network, achieve in a few years.

        <P>

        <P>
            Not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to
            itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield
            those weapons--the digital working class--the creators.  Possessed
            of skills and knowledges that create both social and exchange value,
            resisting reduction to the status of commodity, capable collectively
            of producing all the technologies of freedom, such workmen cannot be
            reduced to appendages of the machine.  Where once bonds of ignorance
            and geographical isolation tied the proletarian to the industrial army
            in which he formed an indistinguishable and disposable component,
            creators collectively wielding control over the network of human
            communications retain their individuality, and offer the value of
            their intellectual labor through a variety of arrangements more
            favorable to their welfare, and to their freedom, than the system of
            bourgeois ownership ever conceded them.

        <P>
            But in precise proportion to the success of the creators in
            establishing the genuinely free economy, the bourgeoisie must
            reinforce the structure of coercive production and distribution
            concealed within its supposed preference for ``free markets'' and
            ``free trade.''  Though ultimately prepared to defend by force
            arrangements that depend on force, however masked, the bourgeoisie at
            first attempts the reimposition of coercion through its preferred
            instrument of compulsion, the institutions of its law.  Like the
            <I>ancien r&#233;gime</I> in France, which believed that feudal property
            could be maintained by conservative force of law despite the
            modernization of society, the owners of bourgeois culture expect their
            law of property to provide a magic bulwark against the forces they
            have themselves released.  

        <P>
            At a certain stage in the development of the means of
            production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society
            produced and exchanged, the feudal organisation of agriculture and
            manufacturing industry, in one word, the feudal relations of property
            became no longer compatible with the already developed productive
            forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they
            were burst asunder.

        <P>
            Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and
            political constitution adapted to it, and by the economic and
            political sway of the bourgeois class.  But ``free competition'' was
            never more than an aspiration of bourgeois society, which constantly
            experienced the capitalists' intrinsic preference for monopoly.
            Bourgeois property exemplified the concept of monopoly, denying at the
            level of practical arrangements the dogma of freedom bourgeois law
            inconsistently proclaimed.  As, in the new digital society, creators
            establish genuinely free forms of economic activity, the dogma of
            bourgeois property comes into active conflict with the dogma of
            bourgeois freedom.  Protecting the ownership of ideas requires the
            suppression of free technology, which means the suppression of free
            speech.  The power of the State is employed to prohibit free creation.
            Scientists, artists, engineers and students are prevented from
            creating or sharing knowledge, on the ground that their ideas imperil
            the owners' property in the system of cultural production and
            distribution.  It is in the courts of the owners that the creators
            find their class identity most clearly, and it is there, accordingly,
            that the conflict begins.  

        <P>
            But the law of bourgeois property is not a magic amulet against the
            consequences of bourgeois technology: the broom of the sorcerer's
            apprentice will keep sweeping, and the water continues to rise.  It is
            in the domain of technology that the defeat of ownership finally
            occurs, as the new modes of production and distribution burst the
            fetters of the outmoded law.

        <P>
            All the preceding classes that got the upper hand, sought to fortify
            their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their
            conditions of appropriation.  Knowledge workers cannot become masters of
            the productive forces of society, except by abolishing their own
            previous mode of appropriation, and thereby also every other previous
            mode of appropriation.  Theirs is the revolutionary dedication to
            freedom: to the abolition of the ownership of ideas, to the free
            circulation of knowledge, and the restoration of culture as the
            symbolic commons that all human beings share.  

        <P>
            To the owners of culture, we say: You are horrified at our intending
            to do away with private property in ideas.  But in your existing
            society, private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of
            the population.  What they create is immediately appropriated by their
            employers, who claim the fruit of their intellect through the law of
            patent, copyright, trade secret and other forms of ``intellectual
            property.''  Their birthright in the electromagnetic spectrum, which
            can allow all people to communicate with and learn from one another,
            freely, at almost inexhaustible capacity for nominal cost, has been
            taken from them by the bourgeoisie, and is returned to them as
            articles of consumption--broadcast culture, and telecommunications
            services--for which they pay dearly.  Their creativity finds no
            outlet: their music, their art, their storytelling is drowned out by
            the commodities of capitalist culture, amplified by all the power of
            the oligopoly of ``broadcasting,'' before which they are supposed to
            remain passive, consuming rather than creating.  In short, the
            property you lament is the proceeds of theft: its existence for the
            few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of everyone else.
            You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of
            property, the necessary condition for whose existence is the
            non-existence of any such property for the immense majority of society.

        <P>
            It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property in
            ideas and culture all creative work will cease, for lack of
            ``incentive,'' and universal laziness will overtake us.

        <P>
            According to this, there ought to have been no music, art, technology,
            or learning before the advent of the bourgeoisie, which alone
            conceived of subjecting the entirety of knowledge and culture to the
            cash nexus.  Faced with the advent of free production and free
            technology, with free software, and with the resulting development of
            free distribution technology, this argument simply denies the visible
            and unanswerable facts.  Fact is subordinated to dogma,
            in which the arrangements that briefly characterized
            intellectual production and cultural distribution during the short
            heyday of the bourgeoisie are said, despite the evidence of both past
            and present, to be the only structures possible.

        <P>
            Thus we say to the owners:  The misconception that induces you to
            transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms
            springing from your present mode of production and form of
            property--historical relations that rise and disappear in the
            progress of production--this misconception you share with every
            ruling class that has preceded you.  What you see clearly in the case
            of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal property,
            you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois
            form of property.

        <P>
            Our theoretical conclusions are in no way based on ideas or principles
            that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be
            universal reformer.  They merely express, in general terms, actual
            relations springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical
            movement going on under our very eyes.

        <P>
            When people speak of ideas that revolutionise society, they do but
            express the fact, that within the old society, the elements of a new
            one have been created, and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps
            even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.

        <P>
            We, the creators of the free information society, mean to wrest from
            the bourgeoisie, by degrees, the shared patrimony of humankind.  We
            intend the resumption of the cultural inheritance stolen from us under
            the guise of ``intellectual property,'' as well as the medium of
            electromagnetic transportation.  We are committed to the struggle for
            free speech, free knowledge, and free technology.  The measures by
            which we advance that struggle will of course be different in
            different countries, but the following will be
            pretty generally applicable:

        <P>

            <OL>
                <LI>Abolition of all forms of private property in ideas.

                    <P>
                </LI>
                <LI>Withdrawal of all exclusive licenses, privileges and rights 
                    to use of electromagnetic spectrum.  Nullification of all conveyances
                    of permanent title to electromagnetic frequencies.

                    <P>
                </LI>
                <LI>Development of electromagnetic spectrum infrastructure that
                    implements every person's equal right to communicate.

                    <P>
                </LI>
                <LI>Common social development of computer programs and all other
                    forms of software, including genetic information, as public goods.

                    <P>
                </LI>
                <LI>Full respect for freedom of speech, including all forms of
                    technical speech.

                    <P>
                </LI>
                <LI>Protection for the integrity of creative works.

                    <P>
                </LI>
                <LI>Free and equal access to all publicly-produced information and
                    all educational material used in all branches of the public education
                    system.
                </LI>
            </OL>

        <P>
            By these and other means, we commit ourselves to the revolution that
            liberates the human mind.  In overthrowing the system of private
            property in ideas, we bring into existence a truly just society, in
            which the free development of each is the condition for the free
            development of all.

                    has used programmers throughout the world--paid and unpaid--since
                    the early 1980s to create the GNU/Linux operating system and related
                    software that can be copied, modified and redistributed by all its

                    that was to have dominated the personal computer revolution as
                    capitalism envisioned it.  By displacing the proprietary production of
                    the most powerful monopoly on earth, the free software movement shows
                    that associations of digital workers are capable of producing better
                    goods, for distribution at nominal cost, than capitalist production
                    can achieve despite the vaunted ``incentives'' created by ownership
