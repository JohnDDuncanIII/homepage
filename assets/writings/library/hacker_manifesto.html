            <p style="text-align:left">Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.<br>
                &quot;Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal&quot;, &quot;Hacker Arrested after<br>
                Bank Tampering&quot;...<br>
                <br>
                Damn kids. They're all alike.<br>
                <br>
                But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's<br>
                technobrain ever take a look behind the eyes of the Hacker? Did you ever<br>
                wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
                <br><br>
                I am a Hacker, enter my world....<br>
                <br>
                Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most<br>
                of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...<br>
                <br>
                Damn underachiever. They're all alike.<br>
                <br>
                I made a discovery today. I found a comupter. Wait a second,<br>
                this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake it's<br>
                because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me...<br>
                Or feels threatened by me...<br>
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...<br>
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...<br>
                <br>
                Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.<br>
                <br>
                And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing<br>
                through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an<br>
                electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencys<br>
                is sought... a bored is found.<br>
                <br>
                &quot;This is it... this is where I belong...&quot;<br>
                I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked<br>
                to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...<br>
                <br>
                Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike...<br>
                <br>
                You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby<br>
                food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you<br>
                did let slip were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by<br>
                sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had somthing to<br>
                teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in<br>
                the desert.<br>
                <br>
                This is our world now... the world of the electron and the<br>
                switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of the service already<br>
                existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by<br>
                profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you<br>
                call us criminals. We seek after knowledge, and you call us criminals.<br>
                We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religous<br>
                bias... and you call us criminals.<br>
                You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and<br>
                lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the<br>
                criminals.<br>
                <br>
                Yes, I am a crimial. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is<br>
                that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look<br>
                like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something you will never<br>
                forgive me for.<br>
                <br>
                I am a Hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this<br>
                individual, but you can't stop us all. After all... we're all alike.<br></p>
