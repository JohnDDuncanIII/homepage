                Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,<br>
                Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
                And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
                Tell that its sculptor  well those passions read<br>
                Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
                The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.<br>
                And on the pedestal these words appear --<br>
                "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br>
                Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"<br>
                Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
                Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br>
